    "text": "Hi, I’m Tom. Thanks for visiting my blog!\nSo my kids are always asking me “Daddy what do you do for work?” well that’s a difficult question and I tried to explain this to them on several occasions…\nI lead and manage the research in multidisciplinary product teams. I enable teams to deliver excellent solutions and services to market by starting with user needs, working in iterative development and validating concepts with users and business.\nI think this was just a bit too much for them to take in… so I thought it might help to have a space to shareand reflect, maybe I would learn a things along the way too!!\nI really really enjoy working in UX. Over the past 15 years I have been very lucky to work with a lot of fabulous product teams and start-ups and through research I’ve able to help them find their purpose, grow, making positive strides forward.\nHaving my own blog really helped me learn about UX, research tools and provided space to test new things; before recommending them as an approach for ‘the real projects’ at work.\nI am really open and honest in all aspects of my work. Here is some the anonymous feedback I have received from colleagues in the few years:\n• “Very passionate, great at organising things and providing insights to the team quickly”\n• “Tom’s expertise in research and research methodologies have helped shape the programmes future development. Specifically, the redesigning and streamlining of key workflows within the referral journey. Tom’s outputs have included key findings on prototype user research, analysis on user behaviour and traits, as well as investigations into processes and business needs.”\n• “Influences change in the product that benefits the user, gives the users a legitimate voice when discussing the product and the design of it, gathers a lot of insights that are useful for influencing design”\n• “He set up the whole of the antigen testing user research programme by himself in a very short space of time. It is an incredible achievement and it is mostly thanks to him that we are where we are right now.”\n• “Excellent research planning, research execution, research findings analysis and high-quality presentations of research findings”\n• “Significant improvements to research efficiency, highly detailed and thorough research outputs, deep thinking on ways of working.”\n• “Tom consistently remains focused on the users needs. He remains empathetic to their situation and is vital in bringing perspective to the discussion when the team requires it.”\n• “Hard working, has a large range of knowledge areas, very good at putting in to action ideas, very good at Qualtrics, very good at using Jira, very good at developing research plans, presents findings back well”\n• “He is very hardworking and dedicated to doing good work that will yield impactful results. He can both work on the ground and think strategically.”\n• “Commitment to UCD ways of working, persistence in solving problems and finding insights, ability to take very complex information and understand it quickly, ability to get the most from tools such as Qualtrics. Tom’s deep subject knowledge and facility with tech is a significant asset to any team.”\n• “Large amounts of detailed information Identification of issues”\nI am very grateful for time people have spent giving feedback whether it was colleagues or project stakeholders.\nIt does help a lot with keeping focussed and finding areas for personal improvement!!\nSend anonymous feedback to Tom: https://bit.ly/Tom360"

    "text": "Moving my blog\n\nThis is the first post in my new Quarto blog. Welcome!\nI’ve decided to close down my previous projects due to several things: ongoing hack attempts, increasing hosting costs, reduced time to manage servers. Using Wordpress for 10 years I’ve learn so much about websites/cloud/apps/dev/data/security, however for my blog i’ve decided the needs are quite simple so using Quarto is a good way to go.\nI’ll gradually be migrating some of the content over from my old blog and Medium. This will continue to be a space where I share how things are going for me, at work and outside"

    "text": "Some positive news\n\n\nWe’ve been working hard to increase awareness of the User Centred-Design Maturity Model, Self-Review Workshops, and Community of Practice. Things were abit slow over the summer months, but gradually things really started to take off. A few larger teams are super keen and booked in lots of workshops, and rightly so some of our teams are skeptical “what another 3 hour workshop?” It does take a while to build up trust and explain the benefits. It is not for our UCD leaders and workshop faciliators to push for workshops too hard, we take a coaching approach and the tool is a self-review process… the evidence of impact can be heard loudly from the great feedback from teams have taken part about the positive changes it has supported them to make.\nThe ‘Reseaarch Panels Best Practice’ workstream is starting to deliver positive outcomes. We’ve designed new way of communicating and recruiting healthcare staff and “professional users”. A pilot has been completed with over 50 staff signing up for the new panel. We’re next working on a comms plan to roll out the service for all our researchers shortly!\nAnti-Racism Allies training - this training (run by HEE) got me reflecting quite deeply on my own personal history and where I grew up. There were some really nice people on the course. Note all the course attendees were white managers from the NHS and our cohort will meet up during 6-month programme. I’m hopeful that I can learn more about myself, gain some wider perspectives, and understand how I can be a better ally in the future.\n\n\nChallenges and puzzles this week\n\n\nTaking on way too much. Our UCD-Ops team is really small, there are so many teams that need help and the problems are often very complex. I really really (really really) enjoy helping people and it gives a great boost when we hear positive feedback from colleagues after helping them, we just want to help more. However, I realise that by helping people all the time it can be a burden on myself, and the team. We’ve talked about pushing back more and what can we do to ensure everyone gets a fair amount of help and they become self-sufficient. We’re looking at ways our team can better signpost help to reduce the number of repeated request."

    "text": "Some positive news\n\n\nThe Leeds UX Lab. Everything is in place to launch this venue for our colleagues to use very soon. It has been a real long road, with so many hurdles to overcome; it was quite an emotional time when we received our training and supplier handover last week. This week I visited again to test out everything we learnt, I plugged in all the equipment and clicked the ‘Start’, ‘Record’ and ‘Go Live’ buttons on the controls. Everything worked as anticipated such a relief!\nBehind the scenes we’ve been ‘doing the hard work’ on our Knowledge Management/Documentation/Policies to support our teams and colleagues during the merger. These resources will help ensure things aren’t lost in transmission but also supports scalability as the organisations align. We’re always looking to collaborate and if teams have resources they can happily feed them into our documentation process.\nMeeting a key supplier. We’ve been working together remotely for many years, so it was great to finally meet the supplier for a brief chat in Leeds and share more about the context in which we work and opportunities to improve the relationship between our researchers and support teams.\n\n\nChallenges and puzzles this week\n\n\nI was super busy over half-term with family and work. I’ve booked 3 days off to repair my mental health and tidy up some things. I’ve personally been through some difficult times during the past few years; I’m not sure I have the mental capacity to go deep thinking at this time. It is so much pressure just to be a good adult role model for 2 kids every day, and run a tight ship; my own needs are to relax, enjoy life and learn how to build trust in people again.\nCoping with a recent loss in the family."
