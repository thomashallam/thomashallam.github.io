Thanks for visiting my blog!\nSo my kids are always asking me “Daddy what do you do for work?” well that’s a difficult question and I tried to explain this to them on several occasions…\nI lead and manage the research in multidisciplinary product teams. I enable teams to deliver excellent solutions and services to market by starting with user needs, working in iterative development and validating concepts with users and business.\nI think this was just a bit too much for them to take in… so I thought it might help to have a space to shareand reflect, maybe I would learn a things along the way too!!\nI really really enjoy working in UX. Over the past 15 years I have been very lucky to work with a lot of fabulous product teams and start-ups and through research I’ve able to help them find their purpose, grow, making positive strides forward.\nHaving my own blog really helped me learn about UX, research tools and provided space to test new things; before recommending them as an approach for ‘the real projects’ at work."

It does help a lot with keeping focussed and finding areas for improvement!!\nSend anonymous feedback to Tom: https://bit.ly/Tom360\nHere is sample of the feedback I received from colleagues in the past few years:\n• “Very passionate, great at organising things and providing insights to the team quickly”\n• “Tom’s expertise in research and research methodologies have helped shape the programmes future development. Specifically, the redesigning and streamlining of key workflows within the referral journey. Tom’s outputs have included key findings on prototype user research, analysis on user behaviour and traits, as well as investigations into processes and business needs.”\n• “Influences change in the product that benefits the user, gives the users a legitimate voice when discussing the product and the design of it, gathers a lot of insights that are useful for influencing design”\n• “He set up the whole of the antigen testing user research programme by himself in a very short space of time. It is an incredible achievement and it is mostly thanks to him that we are where we are right now.”\n• “Excellent research planning, research execution, research findings analysis and high-quality presentations of research findings”\n• “Significant improvements to research efficiency, highly detailed and thorough research outputs, deep thinking on ways of working.”\n• “Tom consistently remains focused on the users needs. He remains empathetic to their situation and is vital in bringing perspective to the discussion when the team requires it.”\n• “Hard working, has a large range of knowledge areas, very good at putting in to action ideas, very good at Qualtrics, very good at using Jira, very good at developing research plans, presents findings back well”\n• “He is very hardworking and dedicated to doing good work that will yield impactful results. He can both work on the ground and think strategically.”\n• “Commitment to UCD ways of working, persistence in solving problems and finding insights, ability to take very complex information and understand it quickly, ability to get the most from tools such as Qualtrics.

    "text": "This post is about how I influenced the service and interaction design team on a major programme to adopt new processes\n\nWhat is a prototype for?\nSeveral weeks after working on the Testing programme I noticed that all the designers from consultancies were only trained to use Sketch.\nTheir agency design approach followed one process:\n\ndraw up some ideas quickly, get them signed off quickly, and code and deploy the solution!\n\nWhile it seemed efficient as a process could get, things became problematic when the team needed to start testing these designs every week. This was an important step to put a few brakes in place to check solutions worked for users, before their national release to the public.\nWe conducted a few rounds of usability testing using these Sketch prototypes; it works o.k. for some projects as you can make the prototype clickable, however\nSketch prototypes are really not ideal for regular usability testing because:\n• you can’t see what a design looks like on different devices (e.g. a mobile view),\n• users cannot interact with form elements,\n• form errors / validation don’t work,\n• users are exposed to button prompts every time they click the incorrect button, leading them to the answer each time, and\n• users may see the comments from designers!\nThese factors make for a very sketchy usability testing session! The participant is unable to experience the service as they would if they were at home on their own. It gives the research and design team mcch less confidence in the research findings.\nFor live-like usability testing I would much prefer to give the participant a link to the prototype that will work on any device they are using, at any resolution, with any additional software tools they have installed.\nI made the case to the consultancy designers that they needed to create these prototypes in html, using the Gov.uk prototype kit; however as they had not done this before as most hadn’t worked as interaction designers on government projects before.\n\n“If you know what good looks like – don’t stand still in a crisis – move things forward!”\n\nHonestly, after working with NHS designers for four years I was really frustrated at the unavailability of an html prototype.\nI decided to take things into my own hands and two days out of my role as a researcher to build the first end-to-end journey using the Gov.uk prototype kit.\nWe tested using this version for two weeks, while NHS Digital quickly redeployed other interaction designers from national programmes to continue the design work and train consultancy staff in best practices for using the prototype kit.\nIn the end, the outcome was positive and the researchers have had good quality prototypes to work going forward; although at the time it was slightly awkward to need to step over an imaginary UR/UX/UI “role boundary” to help speed up an inevitable change.\nObviously this caused some challenges and debates within the team at the time, but from that point on many benefits of being able to design with version controls, test on any device, conduct unmoderated testing. These benefits hopefully far outweighed any initial discomfort within the team.\nMap of the Testing world\nAnother new concept I introduced within the team fairly early on was creating an end-to-end journey map. From the initial gov.uk prototype I created, I took screenshots of every page and linked these up as a flow in Miro (Yes, it took a while!)\nThe primary reason at the time was to help capture notes from multiple user research sessions in the same place, so that we could identify which screens were most problematic by ‘virtually affinity sorting’ the findings.\nThis approach was then adopted by the service designers and interaction designers, who continued to maintain up to date maps of the current, the past and the future design iterations week on week.\nThe resource has been great for user researchers, designers, product, clinical and governance colleagues, but more generally anyone who recently joins the team they can instantly view what the end-to-end service looks like in one place.\n\n\n\nThe e2e journey map I started was kept up-to-date by the UX team for 2 years!"

    "text": "This post is about delivering user research insights within a fast-moving, continually changing, service environment\n\nStakeholders on any critical programme are typically very busy, some key decision makers will only have time to attend a ‘kick off’ meeting and ‘debrief meeting/Show and Tell’.\nOver this summer, our team conducted hundreds of user interviews, across dozens of rounds of research, with people who had requested a coronavirus test.\nThe research team were very proud to be working on such an important project and delivering great insights at pace, however as the weeks past by, and more evidence was gather about the challenges that users were experiencing, I realised we had a problem.\nIn our internal Retro the team discussed why the discovery and usability testing reports were starting to pile but we were unsure why key recommendations were not being actioned. I decided to lead to an internal discovery, to understand where our data was (or wasn’t) going, and how we could improve the user research process to make the findings more impactful.\n\n\n\nFindings from 20 internal interviews with colleagues\n\n\nI arranged 20-minute telephone interviews with internal colleagues and stakeholders: researchers, content managers, clinical leads, product managers, service designers, interaction designers, policy people, information analysts, accessibility leads, programme managers, operations and assurance leads.\nThe goal was to understand their own needs for insight and to unpick the challenges the reserach team were facing; it was also an important opportunity to build trust with colleagues by inviting them to be a participant in our research process.\nHere is our internal research exploration discussion guide:\n\nWhat is your role…? and what do you do?\n\n\nWhat “decisions” are you involved with?\n\n\nDo you produce data or consume data? or both?\n\n\nWhat insights and data do you have access to?\n\n\nWhere does the data come from? i.e. Who provides it?\n\n\nWhat is working well?\n\n\nHow Relevant, Robust, Timely is the data?\n\n\nWhich bits of data are hardest to access/ find?\n\n\nWhat happens with the data you get?\n\n\nHow does data inform decision making?\n\n\nHow is feedback prioritised? (if at all)\n\n\nAre improvements being made following feedback?\n\n\nOverall, how easy or difficult is it to find good feedback / insights / data?\n\n\nWhat would you most like to see improved?\n\nAs with all our discoveries, the anonymised findings had been documented in Miro and further analysis/affinity sorting was conducted to identify the core problems.\nSome of the findings from the continuous improvement discovery included:\n• Product and stakeholders already access loads of data and insight, many of these sources the research were not aware of,\n• Colleagues have limited time to spend listening to the feedback, finding time to observe primary research is almost impossible,\n• Some times our insight hasn’t been seen as robust enough by stakeholders,\n• It was unclear who should take responsibility for the findings and actioning improvements!\nThis lead to myself and the team implementing a number of improvements over the following weeks:\n• Introduce regular, but short, Show and Tells; ideally 15~ minutes presenting and 10-15 minute questions;\n• Arrange follow-up workshops to key agree actions and move these forward,\n• I started creating a repository of findings, so colleagues could see at a glance what is up with the service,\n• Present a 5-minute research update each week at the ‘All staff Stand Up’, to increase awareness of the work,\n• Look to triangulate data (e.g. with analytics) and to start comparing findings over multiple rounds of research,\n• Where there is time, include short video clips in the Show and Tells, to increase the time colleagues have hearing from users.\nWhose research is it anyway?\nI personally learned to appreciate that were many more decisions were being made within the policy, service and product space than the research team were told about – other teams were using other data insight sources much more than we were aware of! Understanding the process helped us to improve how we shared insights too.\nAnother discovery was that as researchers we should not feel need to continually chase-up resolutions to every problem and recommendation presented at the Show and Tell. Many of the team’s research recommendations were valid and important to users, however unless these were complete Show-Stoppers to a committed delivery/policy the recommendations would simply have to wait till things calmed down a bit.\nPlaying a long game: as researchers we provide insights that can lead to a few quick wins, but gathering and presenting robust evidence will inevitably help shape service and product managers thinking, programmes slowly move to being more user-centred over time.\nUnderstanding these internal decision making processes and role boundaries really helped reduce both the burden and stress for reserachers and to improve our focus in future research studies!\n\nTL;DR\nWhen everyone is “very busy” conducting research for a product or service team, it’s too easy to forget the importance of considering how findings will be documented and shared.\nTaking time to reflect on the needs of colleagues and stakeholders who will be consuming the data, and how recommendations get actioned, is very important part of continuous improvement\nTom, NHS Digital – Test and Trace"

    "text": "This post highlights a few workarounds that can deliver good results for projects doing “adhoc” unmoderated testing on your html prototypes\n\nThe journey had so many screens to test, that even with 90-minute interviews we struggled to get robust consistent feedback over multiple rounds of testing This post is about how I created an unmoderated usability testing platform at the Test and Trace service.\nDesigners and product people may just need data to make a few quick decisions. Does this page work better? Does the form work? How can it be optimised? Do people follow on-page instructions? Critically these designs, and decisions, should be validated with users before putting them live.\nHowever when you are working at pace, to some stakeholders and researchers the moderated testing approach can feel like a luxury, even a barrier to delivery. Also moderated testing approaches, and manual analysis of stickies, tends to fall over as soon as any need to split usability findings by different user groups.\nIn one recent Test and Trace project, the end-to-end journey had over 100 pages. We already tested it for 90-minutes over multiple rounds with 4-6 users.\nI appreciate all the evidence and arguments around ‘5 users is enough’ to identify the most critical issues (and all the counter arguments against that too). However, in our experience on this project 5-users (multiple rounds) was still not enough to gather consistent insights as the journey was very long/complex journey that jumps between service channels. We also had some inconsistencies from adjusting focus each Sprint to include new service features/content that needed testing, and differences in opinion among the diverse demographics of users who participated too.\n\nWorkaround Methods to Scale-Up\nI knew we needed to scale-up the research approach, so that we could rapidly and robustly test any element of the service and provide same day insights. Acquring a commercial off the shelf (COTS) unmoderated tool can cost tens/hundreds of thousands, we would need to scope the requirement, find the budget, seek internal approvals, go to market; basically it would take multiple months to procure a tool (if it could be done at all). An alternative solution was required urgently as the finding were needed immediately.\nUsing GitHub and VSCode I deployed a few changes to the same GOV.uk html prototype kit that our interaction designers were using. I designed a research scenario similar to the one we typically use for a moderated interview, adding this as a new “Start page” within the prototype. Users were invited to provide ‘dummy information’ into the forms.\nI then embedded GTM (Google Tag Manager) and from here deployed a number of other conversion optimisation tools such as Google Analytics, Google Optimize (for AB Testing), Inspectlet and HotJar (for on-page feedback, session recording, heatmaps), and Qualtrics (for an exit survey).\nThe main technical challenge beyond installing these tools, was to deploy Cookies and Triggers correctly within GTM to ensure only users who arrived as part of a specific research usability testing activity, who had consented to be tracked, we observed through the journey.*\nThis was because the prototype was already being shared widely with stakeholders, and so it was important to keep research data separate for analysis purposes.\n\n\nTesting at scale\n[Insert anonymised video clip of user session here]\nBy following an unmoderated testing approach, through using our own user panels we were able to test with approximately 1 hundred users each round.\nThis would produce 8 to 10 hours of session replays, which could be reviewed at 2x or 4x speed. As no analytics was available in the live service, we gathered baseline data such as:\n\nnumber of pages visited per user,\nconversion funnels and drop outs,\nkeyboard entry data for forms,\nheatmaps / click analysis,\ntime on task for the journey,\nhow many participants perform a ‘U turn’,\nsatisfaction metrics,\nease-of-use metrics,\ncontextual feedback about all pages in the journey.\n\nOverall this new data helped to validate and prioritise many of the findings we had seen in the moderated testing.\nConclusively, the digital journey is has been demonstrated to be far too long relative to the task of getting a coronavirus test. The consequence is that many users only skim-read the guidance, then abandon later due to usability other issues.\nBeing asked ‘just one more question’ with ‘no end in sight’ and ‘no guarantee of a test’, is not supportive for users with symptoms of a potentially dangerous virus where anxiety and stress is already very high. The product people and stakeholders fed back they had more confidence in our teams’ work now they could see the whole journey had been tested with a whole lot more users.\n\n\nTL;DR\nThe most impactful UX teams are taking a blended approach to different usability methods - combining qualitative, quantitative, analytics and also survey data."

    "text": "This post is about a recent project I conducted with the LGBTQI+ community around ‘Asking about Gender’\n\n\nBefore reading ahead, please be aware some people may find some of this content upsetting.\nTo skip this post please click here to return to the homepage\n\n\nWhen I was asked to look into the Testing needs of transgender users, and to understand how they would feel about some new designs, I was initially very apprehensive.\nTransgender participants are not a user group that I have specifically recruited or interviewed before. I was concerned if the usual research approaches would be suitable. What if I said the “wrong thing” and upset a participant - it might make a contentious situation even worse.\nThen I realised, as a User Researcher, some times ignorance is bliss. Like a passport to speak to anyone - but we still need to do that with respect.\nThe project was a great opportunity lead from the front - learn more about an seldom-heard and diverse user group, and to share learnings with a wide team. With that in mind I looked ahead positively, acknowledging a risk that we may say the wrong thing or ask the wrong question, but doing the research was key to understanding and progressing the service to a better place.\n\nResearch context and planning\nAlways best to follow good practices, but here are some additional considerations that needed to be made to ensure the study reached it’s goal:\n\nMore secondary research was conducted. For example, reviewing previous rounds and exploring voices on social media); we anticipated from this that the service feedback would likely be fairly bad,\nIt was also known that the research could be emotionally challenging for the participants and moderator; I briefed note takers around the sensitivity of the subject,\nWe anticipated drop outs; users were likely to be worried before talking with an organisation they felt had not treated them well. A personalised reminder email or quick call ahead of the sessions, would be an ideal approach. Fortunately, I overbooked as several participants dropped out last minute.\nAs these were remote interviews, we ensured the moderator’s camera was on all the time; this was so that the participant could see who they are talking with, and that we were actively listening to personal and challenging feedback,\nConsent to record - I asked for written and verbal consent. With the option for participants to have their video deleted afterwards. Ideally we would also offer to share a copy of the video with the participant too - they may need to view the journey with their family/friends/support group,\nStart slowly - I knew it would be important to establish trust early in the interview and then cover more difficult topics towards the end of the interview,\nI provided even more opt-outs for participants than usual\n“if there is anything you would prefer not to talk about please let us know.”\n“if we ask a question you are uncomfortable with we are happy to skip that.”\n“If you feel you need to take a break - absolutely that is fine.”\n“Any questions? just ask”\n“Are you ok to go on..?”\nRespecting privacy is always important I asked for permission before asking anything particularly sensitive follow-up questions (e.g. “do you mind if we ask about your gender?”)\nEmpathise with their challenges, but don’t lead responses e.g. “hm… I guess.. in that difficult situation.. I imagine… your feelings might have been…… [pause… wait… listen]” This was probably the biggest challenge with doing this type of research remotely, you need to keep talking and reassuring participant that you are still there and also visibly and actively listening.\nAnonymise evidence - To protect users’ identity, participant numbers were randomised in the report, all faces were blurred in sharing the findings. We deleted the original recordings as quickly as feasible\n\n[To add later - Image of Testing screen / Quotes from research]\n\nImmediately after the research - 21/11\nBeing briefly in someone else’s shoes is a mysterious thing. Remote researchers may rarely come across precious moments like this. It took several weeks, for the impact of this research to fully sink in. For several days immediately after conducting these interviews, I felt fully unproductive and distracted whenever asked to join other meetings and having to context switch.\nI was keen to complete the research and analysis, knowing if it takes to long, the strong connection between participant and moderator fades away. What I heard was so impactful to me, I didn’t want to let this message just pass by, or to lose focus on the goal of sharing valuable insight about the vulnerable group (who by this time we knew they felt they were badly discriminated against - i.e. denied access to Tests).\nTheir story needed to be shared, loud and clearly.\nRealising the possible significance of this work, it quickly turned into fears. The pressure of delivering the insight, truthfully, in a way that respects users’ privacy and gender identity, but brings the full raw emotional view from the participants to share their individual needs.\nI spent several days (and late nights) immersed among data for the important analysis; watching the clips over-and-over to fully understand the issues, how best the message could be shared broadly.\nIn the end, I was unable to find a way to describe the findings that would do justice to the emotion of what had been said. I then decided to anonymise all the key video clips for the team and played these back at an extended Show and Tell.\nOver 80 colleagues attended and the output was received with great appreciation from the Reserach, Design, EDI Team (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion) team and LGBT community.\nWhat people were unaware I was in bed feeling sick and deeply upset about the study findings; how would I feel to continue working on a service that has caused this distress for thousands of people during a national health crisis? Staying on the pitch to make sure the research had an impact, rather than walking away with anguish, was my way of keeping the momentum going towards a change and to hopefully make the service just a bit better.\nA few weeks later - 6/12\nIt is still a difficult project for me to think about. Like many other emotinally-charged projects i’ve worked on in the past decade, I don’t think I’ll be able to forget this one either. Knowing the signs of emotional burden, third-party (vicarious) trauma, and knowing when and how to seek support from colleagues or professionals makes it feel safer to do these studies.\nFor researchers, knowing that services accidentally (or deliberately) discriminate against user groups is important. It still happens today - even in 2020. Inclusion and accessibility are both principles and legal commitments, but in reality most public services aren’t fully equitable or inclusive.\nIt can’t be underestimated how upsetting it is for the people to go through experiences like that, where a service with just few words written on a page, can makes a person feel so insignificant to make them feel in their own words “like they don’t even exist”.\nSpeaking to vulnerable user groups and carrying these heavy burdens is perhaps why many research and design teams stick to researching the ‘middle of the road’. Public sector teams need to learn much more vulnerable user groups, key insight is often found at the edges.\nThere is a real risk, that without more diverse participation in research studies, that teams are acidentally designing for “middle class, digitally savvy, well-educated, vehicle owners, mostly white, with lots of spare time.” However, the audience who really need testing is skewed towards under-representative communities who are being hardest hit by the virus.\nI appreciate the main challenge “Asking about Gender with trans communities” hasn’t actually been fixed (as yet - Dec 2020), but my research has helped stimulate conversations and collaborations towards finding a solution to the long-standing-root-cause problems (i.e. that GP record’s are not inclusive, it’s difficult match users to a GP record).\nIn the short term these findings have improved understanding of a seldom-heard community, and raised the quality bar in the Testing and Vaccination services to ensure we they are ‘more inclusive’ with design and hopefully, with time, the service can be ‘fully inclusive’.\n\n\nTL;DR\nResearching sensitive topics with hard to reach users is critical for understanding what happens ‘around the edges’ of a service.\nIt is a heavy burden for all involved, so aim to do it just once and deliver the research with a profound impact.\nAs UCD practictioners we need to hear the raw words and emotion to understand complex user needs; fixing these issues is difficult but not only does it make the service more inclusive, but it builds trust and respect across all user groups."

    "text": "Some backstory…\nAfter graduating with an International Business degree from a great uni I had high ambitions. However it was 2009 and the global financial crisis had just hit everything, most grad schemes had closed for applications.\nThere was also a general election 2010 and the government department where I completed my industrial work placement was closed down as part of the spending review – all the people I worked with were made redundant or let go. Many good people were looking for work it was a tough time to be a graduate.\nAnyway, after months being unemployed doing the job-centre-thing and contacting many employers every single day, eventually I got lucky landing my first job out of uni as a temp research worker at the niche kids research and games design agency Dubit.\nOver 4 years, I learnt the ropes took on more challenging projects and was very fortunate to work with big media brands such as Channel 4, Sky, EDF Energy and Random House publishing (and many others just to name a few).\nWhat was most fortunate about this job, was not the clients, but the research team who at the time (around 2010) were really top of the user-insight game. They strongly believed that using mixed-methods, co-creation/user-centred design and working in close collaborations with their clients was the best way to deliver successful products and services to market. Although it was only a small team, it was a very exciting the time.\n\n\nHow do we discover?\nOne particular project I gladly remember was conducting twenty in-home immersive interviews to study children’s mobile gaming habits, lifestyles and entertainment interests for a media company.\nThe client was exploring a “new app” in the fast-growing kids games segment at the time. Of course the client didn’t want to be named in case any competition found out about the research/app. From the start all the app designs and research stimulus contained a funky project codename. Their app wasn’t production ready at all, only a proof of concept (very basic with some embedded free games like Tetris / minesweeper).\nI travelled all over the country to moderate these two-hour sessions in family homes – after some introductions with parents and talking through the project brief, we’d do a few warm-up activities before letting their kids loose on the ‘new app’. After 20-minutes only this new app had spoken for itself – kids had got bored quickly and wanted to return to their own iPads.\nI’d then let the session flow into discovery and explore the plethora of 2D/3D immersive freemium games that were available at the time. Unsurprisingly most parents were not bothered by content guidelines so six years old kids could easily be playing games aged 10+. As long as the kids weren’t buying things in the App store and their parents could take a break, everyone was happy.\nWhile doing these in-home discovery/testing sessions, it was important to be ready with lots of backup activities for when the “app testing” ended.\nE.g. a “Day in the life of challenge”… or an Argos catalogue moodboard. Can you group together all the toys and games they have into new/used, or talk about which characters you like/dislike, or what things do you want for Christmas? what games are kids at school playing? etc… with the consent from parents we may view kids online history or YouTube playlists, to see what they are routinely searching for (and so what brands they see most often).\nWhen we played back the “app testing” research to the client team it was clear this app would have performed pretty badly in it’s current form. This led to more intrigue around what we had learnt during the discovery, our evidence prompted a rethink for the client’s product design.\nFurther co-creation work with real end users was conducted at the in-house games development studio; eventually some new ideas became a real thing that required proper usability testing… and so circling back around insight from this throw-away-app gave rise to a much more successful product that is still available today (almost 10 years later)!\n\n\nWhat about discovery in the health sector?\nI’ve worked as a User Researcher in the healthcare sector for six years now. Many teams often talk about their discovery and profound understanding user needs, indeed it is a requirement for GDS and NHS.uk Service Standards.\nFrom the many hundreds of research projects and thousands of interviews that I have seen, or been part of, real discovery research rarely happens, in my view.\nHere are some issues that are routinely observed:\n1. It’s usually not for the want of trying by User Researchers, but there broadly is no culture of discovery. Programme management don’t acknowledge a need to understand users context, lifestyle, values, motivations, needs. Usually programme management are mandating digital teams deliver a thing committed by ‘VIP stakeholder / HIPPO’\n2. Also very few teams are working on research and solving “real problems” around a root cause. All the time is spent understanding and unpicking the consequences of previous projects, so it is almost impossible to get a new and proper greenfield discovery off the ground\n3. Everyone we work with is a patient, so everyone becomes “an expert user advocate”; there is an assumption that teams know users but often they are over confident and think that no discovery is required\n4. The same teams have usually been in place many years; collectively they assume they have user knowledge, a shared expertise, that means discovery is also not required\n5. When discovery happens, it is timeboxed to a few short weeks. Discovery at worst it is a 15-minute warm-up activity before showing some screenshots. This happens a lot\n6. Discovery scope is often limited to digital interactions only. Often discoveries are narrowed to a product channel/theme that is a focus of a new feature (e.g. can we discover what communication channel people want to receive alert messages on?)\n7. If real discovery is happening, which I don’t believe it is, sharing of this information more widely is not happening\n8. Discovery teams often get closed down if they don’t also come up with ‘a solution’\n\n\nMaking health discovery a bit better\nTo change the outcomes, we need to change the process and inputs.\nReally good discovery should be ongoing ethnography, both tactical (e.g. thematic) and more strategic (e.g. longitudinal or lifestyle)\nWe need to be more honest about this, so when we are asked ‘who are our users’ and ‘what are their needs’.\nIf a proper discovery has not been completed in the last 18 months, the best answers too give are:\n\nA “We don’t yet know as we’ve not done much discovery work recently”\n\n\nA* “We have documents needs and/or personas, but these are based only historical discovery evidence, subject matter expertise, and/or assumptions that may be wrong”\n\nIdeally teams would complete discovery, and continue to learning about users needs throughout service and product lifecycle.\nWhile discussing a new urgent requirement, and whether discovery is needed it can be a difficult conversation. But it’s important to persist and champion this need to give the project and service users the best opportunity for a successful outcome.\nHave you ever heard a Product Owner or Delivery manager say any of these phrases? If so then your user researcher/s have certainly done a great job in embedding a culture of research and discovery within the team.\nAAA**\n\n“We are not our users”\n\n “We are aware of our internal unconscious bias, cultural norms, that make us different to our users”\n\n “We listen to users, but don’t judge users”\n\n “We have empathy, not sympathy”\n\n “We care about our users and we want them to have a great experience”\n\n “We want our users to achieve their goal efficiently”\n\n “We’ve actually meet end users, a good cross-section”\n\n “We spoke to the people who have abandoned/rejected using our service”\n\n “We spent a decent amount of time in their environment”\n\n “We observed them without interfering with their day”\n\n “We understand their context, in a way that is broader than our service model”\n\n “We enjoy talking about their pain points and underlying needs”\n\n “We understand that their needs change from time-to-time”\n\n “We learn about our users behaviour through qualitative and quantitative data”\n\n “We regularly co-design with our end users”\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nWorking in a digital multidisciplinary team it is almost impossible to get a “real discovery” off the ground. It’s not just a commitment and funding issue, but a lack of understanding.\nWe need more programme directors who understand what a real discovery looks like and can smells fake discoveries a mile off.\nProduct teams need to get closer to users, immerse themselves, among insights about the lifestyles of end users to identify real user needs and root cause problems."

To summarise this in 120 characters was a nightmarish task for the Census 2021.\n\n\n\nSenior User Research role\n\n\nAnyway to elaborate further - this post is inspired by me trying to explain briefly to my six year old what I do at work. “Listening to people” and “remote calls most of the day” didn’t seem much of an explanation!\nI lead and manage User Research strategy, resources, operations for our team; ensuring the NHS service meets User Needs.\nLead\n\nSet a vision and direction for work within the team. Why are we here? What do we want to achieve this Sprint?\nInspire colleagues and stakeholders - lead by example,\nShare our successes,\nEncourage the team to be brave,\nAsking the challenging questions,\nEmpower and support the team, vFacilitate change within the team/service, identify and help improve anything else that could be better\n\nManage\n\nEnsure we have a plan! Manage a backlog of research requests. Scope, triage, and prioritise the requests with the team\nManage our team (onboarding, well-being, performance, support, training, coaching, mentoring, timesheets, leave and absence, holidays, one to ones, etc.)\nOwn the quality benchmark for the team. If things go wrong take some responsibility and learn from it\n\nStrategy\n\nNHS.uk Service Standards!\nGDS Principles - Start with User Needs\nGDS Standard / Service lifecycle - Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live\nAgile / Cynefin - identifying appropriate research methods to use for different (simple and complex) research projects\nResearch ethics / best practice and principles\nAligning priorities across multiple UR / UX / CX teams\n\nResources\n\nEnsure we have enough researchers, recruitment!\nEnsure research skills match the tasks at hand\nCoordinate the research budget / ensure appropriate spend\n\nOperations\n\nFacilitating continuous improvement - e.g. Retros\nAgreeing processes / workflows across teams\nWays of working & regular research cadence - UR a team sport!\nQuality assurance of research and outputs\nEnsuring correct research tooling, working with suppliers\nData governance, GDPR\n\nService + User needs\n\nFacilitate the user voice and bringing empathy into the heart of the service\nBuild a narrative around users’ stories and how this has changed over time\nFacilitating insights sharing among colleagues / stakeholders (Service design, interaction design, content design, product owners, stakeholders)\nEnsure the service is inclusive and meets access needs.

As I really enjoy all the frontline research and hearing users talk about the thing, I really hope to continue observing regular research sessions and attend the (many) research playbacks too!\nImportantly I need colleagues to remind me “not to worry about the details” as we now have an expanded team who manage and deliver the research activities. The processes we have work well and the team are brilliant, always deliver great insight, always improving things too.\nIf you are interested in learning more about what Senior User Researchers do I’m always happy to share more insight about this challenging and rewarding role.

    "text": "User journey for the sprint\n\n\nThe last round of research I delivered was in January, since then our amazing team of User Researchers have been ploughing ahead delivering great projects and new insights every week. We’re on Sprint 22 (Round 165) currently!\nHaving just enough researchers enabled me to spend more time scoping requests, planning ahead and working on some continuous improvement themes that support our researchers to improve overall quality and work more effectively.\nI like to regularly remind our team that I’m super keen to attend at least one research session each week! As a kinaesthetic learner I love hearing users’ stories first hand - it lasts much longer than hearing findings being played back at another Show and Tell (yes there are many UR playbacks each week!!)\nThis week was a really interesting week, and maybe I did speak to soon about getting immersed in some research… Due to resource changes in our team and several ‘urgent requests / policy updates / user journey changes’ I needed to jump straight back into a high-priority discovery project and deliver some actual research.\nIt was a crazy week-or-so but yesterday, the 2-week discovery concluded and the project team have enough user insight to feedback to their delivery board and (hopefully) to make the right decisions ahead of going into Alpha.\n\nSo what did we do ?\n\n\n\nImage: Calendar showing busy week with 12 user interviews and loads of stakeholder meetings in between!\n\n\nWednesday (14th) - Thursday (15th)\n\nDiscovery project kick off - understanding the business problem and objective. Defining what we need to learn about our users and their needs.\nCreating service design concepts (to do the right thing) - working really closely with service design / content / policy / clinical and operations\nArrange recruitment for 12 participants with a variety of test experience and from different demographic groups.\nUsually we might only gather feedback from 5-6 users however as there were four contrasting concepts we thought we would need 8-10 users to get a robust overall preference\n\nFriday (16th) - Monday (19th)\n\nSketch user flows, heuristic review to question any assumptions\nPrepare content to support testing, check with clinical / policy / legal / ops. ** Early content testing is helpful for understanding awareness, perceived value and sentiment about concepts. It can also identify motivators/detractors that may can make the comms/onboarding for a new concept succeed or fail.\nPrepared research scripts, reviewed these with the team and stakeholders to understand if the objectives and questions would meet everyone’s needs\nMoved 5 research sessions booked for Monday back to later in week - the content wasn’t ready just yet.\n\nTuesday (20th)\n\nInterview users / test concepts (5 users) 1 hour session each with short break. ** Usually at least 1-2 would drop out so we overbook but un/fortunately everyone turned up - it was a REALLY long day!!\nInterim analysis required for digital Standup next day\n\nWednesday (21st)\n\nAM - regular team meetings; these are really important to keep in touch and plan ahead even when the research is still going on at full pace. It gives you a break to reflect on things with colleagues\nPM - continue interviews! (3 more users)\nStakeholder engagement at various project meetings\n\nThursday (22nd)\n\nAM/PM - interview users / test concepts. 2 more users / 1 cancellation).\nIt turned out that by user 8 we already had a clear favourite and second favourite concepts, however these final 2 users helped validate that insight with another demographic segment\nLunch - went for a short walk and the first chance to reflect on the findings\nStakeholder engagement at various project meetings\n\nFriday (23rd)\n\nAM - Finalise analysis on Miro\nAM - Finalise presentation\nPM - 45 minute debrief for Discovery project team\nPM - Pay incentives, project admin wrap, distribute report\n\nMonday (26th)\n\nAM - Planning for next Sprint\nPM - Show and Tell - Wider stakeholders\nNow usually I don’t work Fridays due to compressed working hours, but this project was quite intense so despite working long hours mid-week and with support from the team it wasn’t actually possible to get it all done in Mon-Thurs; this has left me rather cream-crackered this weekend!\n\n\n\nReflections on things I’ve learnt this year\nIt often is a hectic schedule in the design/research space on a national programme - policy changes frequently… and so the service design, interaction and content design change frequently too!\nUnderstandably when delivering at pace, some decisions would be difficult to make without any end user insight - user research while important can also be viewed as ‘a blocker’ if everyone is sat around waiting around for ‘an answer’. We don’t like our team to be perceived as slowing things down a lot (of course research does take some time) because more key decisions are then made without any research. We know where that happens assumptions and bias are more likely to creep in.\nDue to the concern of delaying progress on a key national service - I’ve spent a lot of time over the year trying to improve our research cadence and efficiency. Things like automated participant management (panels), standardising recruitment and interview scheduling approach, consistent analysis approaches, these have all sped things up. Another major benefit of consistent team and consistent approaches is when colleagues have to drop-in to support last minute there isn’t a ‘forming/storming/norming’ phase - everyone can just continues ‘performing’.\nAnother thing I’ve realised however is that, no matter how quick the research can be delivered, there is always another project (or 10!) waiting to be delivered as urgently. This usually becomes apparent just as the current one is wrapping up. To cope with constant pressure to deliver quality at pace we ask all our researchers to book time off regularly (including me), and to arrange ‘fire breaks’ every 4-5 weeks to ensure we have time to reflect, consolidate learnings and recover from working flat out!\n\n\nTL;DR\nThere are many significant challenges while delivery at pace on national systems, this has been particularly noticeable on systems that are central to the response for managing the Coronavirus pandemic.\nIt has been a fantastic experience to even be involved such a national effort; and I hope our research has made a positive contribution to improving things for end-users!\nI have huge respect for the amazing researchers across the many organisations I’ve collaborated with recently (NHS, Deloitte, Kainos, BJSS, Hippo Digital, and other contracting companies) they have all been giving it their everything and have delivered over 1,000 user interviews during the last year.\nIt feels like on Testing we’re all about ready for a long break - the barista at Costa tells me that on May 17th it’s all over! But who knows what this year will bring?"

Things were abit slow over the summer months, but gradually things really started to take off. A few larger teams are super keen and booked in lots of workshops, and rightly so some of our teams are skeptical “what another 3 hour workshop?” It does take a while to build up trust and explain the benefits. It is not for our UCD leaders and workshop faciliators to push for workshops too hard, we take a coaching approach and the tool is a self-review process… the evidence of impact can be heard loudly from the great feedback from teams have taken part about the positive changes it has supported them to make.\nThe ‘Reseaarch Panels Best Practice’ workstream is starting to deliver positive outcomes. We’ve designed new way of communicating and recruiting healthcare staff and “professional users”. A pilot has been completed with over 50 staff signing up for the new panel. We’re next working on a comms plan to roll out the service for all our researchers shortly!\nAnti-Racism Allies training - this training (run by HEE) got me reflecting quite deeply on my own personal history and where I grew up. There were some really nice people on the course. Note all the course attendees were white managers from the NHS and our cohort will meet up during 6-month programme. I’m hopeful that I can learn more about myself, gain some wider perspectives, and understand how I can be a better ally in the future.\n\n\nChallenges and puzzles this week\n\n\nTaking on way too much. Our UCD-Ops team is really small, there are so many teams that need help and the problems are often very complex. I really really (really really) enjoy helping people and it gives a great boost when we hear positive feedback from colleagues after helping them, we just want to help more. However, I realise that by helping people all the time it can be a burden on myself, and the team. We’ve talked about pushing back more and what can we do to ensure everyone gets a fair amount of help and they become self-sufficient. We’re looking at ways our team can better signpost help to reduce the number of repeated request."

This week I visited again to test out everything we learnt, I plugged in all the equipment and clicked the ‘Start’, ‘Record’ and ‘Go Live’ buttons on the controls. Everything worked as anticipated such a relief!\nBehind the scenes we’ve been ‘doing the hard work’ on our Knowledge Management/Documentation/Policies to support our teams and colleagues during the merger. These resources will help ensure things aren’t lost in transmission but also supports scalability as the organisations align. We’re always looking to collaborate and if teams have resources they can happily feed them into our documentation process.\nMeeting a key supplier. We’ve been working together remotely for many years, so it was great to finally meet the supplier for a brief chat in Leeds and share more about the context in which we work and opportunities to improve the relationship between our researchers and support teams.\n\n\nChallenges and puzzles this week\n\n\nI was super busy over half-term with family and work. I’ve booked 3 days off to repair my mental health and tidy up some things. I’ve personally been through some difficult times during the past few years; I’m not sure I have the mental capacity to go deep thinking at this time. It is so much pressure just to be a good adult role model for 2 kids every day, and run a tight ship; my own needs are to relax, enjoy life and learn how to build trust in people again.\nCoping with a recent loss in the family."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Image: Daniel Lerman\n\n\n\nPre-Discovery is a thing.\n\nI’ve been asked about: “What is a Pre-Discovery”?\n\nPre-Discovery is helpful for teams working on existing products and services where data can be gathered from internal resources. It should underpin the User Research Discovery themes and will make a big difference to the users approached and the questions asked during Discovery.\nTeams with an existing service will have questions such as:\n\nHow frequently is our service currently used?\nWhat is the demographic of the current user base?\nWhat have our users already told us about the current product?\nWhat are users pain points?\nWhat do users do before arriving in our service?\nWhat do users do after using our service?\nWhat are the main outcomes from using our service?\n\nTeams should list out the many dozens of questions they may need to answer through Discovery and then assess whether any internal data sources will answer this before kicking off new research.\n\nWhy more Pre-Discovery is helpful\nDiscovery is a awesome, challenging and rewarding too. Meeting users, getting immersed in their environment, understanding nuances in their needs. But Discovery is expensive and time consuming so we need to do try and answer questions effectively, in a targeted way.\n\n\n\nHere is my Pre-Discovery checklist:\n\nReview all previous research reports and surveys to identify relevant insight about a thing\nSpeak to service desk and review a sample of relevant service tickets\nReview analytics and performance data for the thing\nReview business case and benefits case for the thing, to see what benefits we expect users will see\nRun a quick session with Product, Sales or Implementation team to understand if there is knowledge or previous evidence about the thing\nHighlight in a service map where the thing sits in relation to other things\nEvaluate the benefits of fixing the thing\n\nTeams may say these activities should just happen in Discovery…\nWhile possibly true, most teams need to raise funding to pursue Discovery research and delivery projects and Pre-Discovery may be helpful to flesh out the business case and specify some problems to solve.\nGathering user research evidence for benefits early sets in motion good practice that should be continued through Discovery and Alpha. This also can help a team quickly surface all the key issues whether they need further understanding.\nGathering this data during Pre-Discovery won’t help you to confirm user needs, you will still need depth Discovery research. It also won’t help you identify the best solution, you will also need Alpha research and iterative design .\n\nMore benefits of Pre-Discovery\nPre-Discovery gives researchers some time to start thinking about finding the right users and starting recruitment so there is a seamless transition into Discovery when an Agile team may scale out and exploratory research and technical work really kicks off in earnest.\nPre-Discovery usually involves a limited number of roles too. A User Researcher, UX Designer, Service Designer and Business Analyst. It can take a few days to a few weeks to gather relevant insights.\n\n\nGetting buy in for your Pre-Discovery\nShare your Pre-Discovery evidence with key stakeholders and sponsors, to answer the question ‘What do we know?’, ‘What else do we need to know?’ and why should we buy into continue into Discovery phasee? Give them a flavour of the future: how will their world be better when they know more about how to solve a thing?\nKeeping momentum going\nIf more business cases were based on User Needs and Pre-Discovery evidence with further staged funding towards the end of Discovery/Alpha, there would surely be a lot less disappointment for users and stakeholders when product launches go awry. Less feature commitments will be promised that are later abandoned quietly during Discovery or Alpha, and importantly less irrelevant and implausible features will continue through to live service deployment.\nGetting started with UR projects isn’t always easy — Chicken or egg first? How do you complete a Pre-Discovery on the thing without funding or resources?\nBreaking the cycle is challenging especially when most teams might already at capacity with their existing commitments.\nInnovative organisations embed Pre-Discovery into their standard process for Strategy, Policy and Product. This support alignment at all levels to ensure outcomes are based on both user needs, and business needs.\n\n\n\nHow did your Pre-Discovery go?\nIf you found this post interesting or useful please comment below :) it would be great to hear your stories of Pre-Discovery!!"

    "text": "Reply\nReally interesting question. I’ve not seen any formal guidance on it –\nI guess my answer would be yes it varies between services. Big enough so you can get some useful insight and Small enough that it is low key and no one notices if you have to pull it?\nThe last thing you want for your ‘Private Beta’ service is to spend ages setting up a private beta panel/community only to not have enough users going through to gain any useful insight, this would be very expensive means of testing and validating a thing\nFor the new NHS Manage Your Referral Service (part of NHS e-Referral Service). We ran a very very small public beta. The old national service has around 1 million transactions per year, we used a tiny link on the homepage of the old service to redirect about 1% of users, we later made a more prominent link which redirected about 10%.\nWe had (for a few months) only a few dozen users per day — around 10% provided survey feedback (5–10 users per day) but the survey and analytics base sizes weren’t robust enough to say if it was statistically an improvement (e.g. Satisfaction/completion rate) over an old service it was due to replace — was this just by chance due to low sample and high margin of error.\nWhat you can do though with only a few users is analyse individual users and see why people drop off and the errors and make some informed changes based on analytics / database queries, that needs to be part of the private or public beta plan. Until you scale up you won’t know for sure if the private beta data is robust and the service is cooking on gas as many weird errors/alternative use cases that you won’t find in private beta testing are much less likely to occur with only a handful of users!\nI guess it comes back to your service, questions for the PO and UR to think about might be:\n\nwhat are the objectives are for private beta?\nwhat is the means for validating incremental improvements?\nis there is a drive/need to go for public beta?\nhow many changes are you planning to test? as you will need much larger numbers e.g. if using AB or multi variate testing,\nhow quickly can the team resolve issues/make changes?\nwhen should we scale up? how long will it take to gather * data to validate that it works?\n\nHope this helps!\nTom"

Whether this is through discovery interviews, co-creation & service design activities, or usability testing content and solutions; it is almost always impossible to make the right decisions without user research.\nAt a practical level, user researcher can’t answer every question, nor should they. There is a need to work with product leaders to createa a product strategy or roadmap to solve user problem. Even then, this strategy should not be taken as gospel, user research should support working through much of the finer details.\nThe correct (ironic) answer to these above quotes are:\nOk,the time when your really don’t need User Research is after the solution has been launched unsuccessfully and the project has to be closed down!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Great Logo: When Stakeholders Attack!\n\n\n\nWhy did I go?\nAs a User Researcher working in the NHS, it seems every project I have been involved in over 4 years has had ample stakeholders (internal and external) lobbying to influence the direction whether that is during planning, discovery research, design or delivery stages.\nEveryone seems to hold an opinion, on everything — all the time, opinion-based-judgement seems to disrupt the evidence-based process of identifying the right problem to solve and finding the best solution.\nThese experiences lead me to snap-up a ticket to the first Product People Midlands event. I was really impressed and excited to see an interesting event like this happening outside of London.\n\n\nWhat was this event about?\nAptly named ‘When stakeholders attack’ the meet-up set off with friendly words from the host Si Manby (ManbySi)and the event didn’t disappoint following that.\nThis was a great no-holds-barred think-out-loud debate about the major challenges facing many Product Managers and Product Teams across departments.\nThe presenters focused on re-occurring problem areas and each brought a key quotes to start their talk and discussion:\nKaz Hufton (@Kaz_H_666)\n \nThe talk focused on evidence of a fundamental misunderstanding of what “discovery” means,\n“every time I do a project I have to explain what a discovery is, and why we are doing it, to the same people. Like 68 times.”\n“It took me a year to realise what we were doing was based on a ‘Solution Definition’ and ‘Project Initiation’ documents that was written by one person and was based solely on their assumptions. The discovery stage was merely the first stage clearly marked out on their waterfall chart.”\nAlice Cudmore (@alice_cudmore)\n\nA great quote — probably the most over-used phrase I’ve heard.\n\nTo counter this question, there are suggestions around asking “why do you need to know”. Inevitably this would unpack a whole host of internal problems around fixation on timelines and milestone tracking, money, internal politics, resourcing problems, scope creep, and yes, more money.\n\n\n“Somehow there is no realisation when someone leaves you can’t just drop-ship in a new person with identical skills and experience; that the delivery of stuff is going to slow down.” Lauren Tombs (@TombsLauren)\n\n\nThe talk focused on product owners experiences of actually being empowered to decide things, but this constrained by excessive stakeholder requirements at the expense of user needs, usability, deliver-ability, and perhaps even common sense.\nSome great examples and it seems some projects have really tried every different stakeholder engagement approach to getting around this barrier,\nOne thought from from the floor… “If stakeholders want to block a project they will, can anything be done?”\n\n\nWhat else was discussed?\nThe session was 50%-masterclass, 50%-peer-therapy.\nThose attending added some quality case studies too from their vast years of product experience too.\nThe discussions touched on many broader problems within departments,\n\nBureaucratic internal approvals and support (e.g. procurement) processes,\nLack of trust and empowerment in teams,\nDocuments for the sake of documents, even when it is never read,\nLack of vision and intent from senior management,\nLessons not being learned time and again.\n\n\n\nSo who else attended?\nWell you may or may not know them, but if you work with them you have probably heard them. They are often noisey, nosey, confrontational perhaps, contrarians yes, asking lots of awkward questions yes, blunt yes, rude — perhaps? Still can’t find them.. Look for a person not wearing a blue or grey suit. Possibly a T-shirt.\n\nChallengers to say the least. Yes, these are the Product People — an emerging force of thinkers, doers, realists, persuaders who have are massively passionate about what they do and have a full grasp of their users, the business and technology.\n\nThose Product Managers, Product Leads, Senior Product Owners are seemingly doing a lot of hard work to put whimsically-flimsey ideas through their paces and deliver stuff of actual end-user value and quality for organisations.\nOne experienced manager was asked how they should decide who internally would a suitable for that role,\n“Look at your department and pick the people who are asking the most awkward questions.”\nAnother speaker noted “Problems were occurring on several projects as the previous Product Manager was saying yes to everyone’s requests without thinking.”\n“If you’re not saying No and upsetting someone most weeks you’re probably not doing it right.”\nProduct managers seem to be routinely confused with project managers, delivery managers, and service owner roles. Bizarrely, as pointed out, these Product Managers are set objectives and assessed on delivering value, however this often flies in direct conflict with colleagues whose objectives are set to deliver specific features.\nSome debate occurred around a perception that the role of GDS as a “referee of quality” and “stick to wave” it’s is not functioning as well as it previously as a central function, with formal assessments. People just ignore the User needs bit and skip into design, the Product managers are being asked whats the minimum they could do to pass the assessment.\nAlso, questions surrounded the role “Service Manager” while that started with a good intention, it could have become diluted and confused to the point it is almost meaningless.\n\n\nWhat was the event like?\nWell the story unfolded fast, but not like the David and Goliath where a simple slingshot brings a giant to it’s knee.\nNo this was something else, much akin to the Resistance vs. the First Order in the Star Wars Last Jedi. The unyielding, unmerciful, crushing, gripping nature of the order on the product community working across departments was pretty clear.\n\nHowever, from the resistance side it wasn’t all poke-fun at Mr Blobby and the order, as that’s easily done. The discussions were tempered with empathy with the group considering the other side of the coin too… interesting questions were raised like:\n“What might be motivating stakeholders and organisations to put in place these constraints?”,\n“Why are they risk averse?”, “Why do they oppose change?”,\n“Can transformation really be complete if they (..read the staff..) oppose all change?”,\n“Why would people who benefit from hierarchy for 20 years or more want to empower their teams?”.\n\n\nMy thoughts following the event\nThe strange thing to me, in this story about products an delivery life-cycles, ironically and sadly the ‘product community’ are cast as the pantomime villains.\nThe collective insight, expertise and experience at the meet was shocking… shocking in the sense that such a group who clearly have huge talent and can add so much value to organisations have had to suffer so many battle scars and have so many ridiculous tales to tell. Why do organisations not learn from past mistakes?\nWhat with it being 2019, I’m not sure whether it was reassuring or concerning to learn these problems exist and seem consistent across departments.\nThe answers during the discussion were considered, and the situation seems vastly complex, so it’s not surprising that any transformation across departments is hard to start and even harder to make stick.\nOne point felt clear. Between the old and new ways of doing things, it seems like stalemate. On both sides now and this results in ignoring or ridiculing, rather than trying to find any solution.\nLack of user-centered and product-focus, probably means that many times things are being built based on assumptions; opportunities are likely to be missed too and delivery is not always going to succeed.\nMy question to readers would be ‘Should Product Management and following user-centered design still be considered a movement, or is that seen as best practice, and — in essence — the new norm?’\n\n\nTL;DR\nThe Product People community is growing and maturing. Be aware, boo is coming to a goose near you.\nThis was a great event in the Midlands, even when the group skimmed the stone across the top of the lake, rather than just focusing on the topic ‘When Stakeholders Attack’ there was really interesting, thoughtful discussion and banter.\nWould I go to the next Product People midlands event? 5 stars yes for sure. There are so many important topics to explore that I only hope there are more events like this (outside London).\nWell that’s my take out anyway :)"

    "text": "I’ve seen teams design lovely journeys and content but not understanding what is the core thing they do that adds value for their users.\nIn UX the focus is often to understand users and their needs, obviously that is important but, this is different from having a strong value proposition.\nSolutions are typically created to meet a need identified in Discovery, usability testing an Alpha will tell us if it is usable. Somewhere in the middle of Discovery and Alpha often things get lost and stuff gets released without initially exploring if the team are creating a strong value proposition.\nCan this new thing be described succinctly in a way that is appealing and effectively communicates why people should use the new product / service / feature. If it can’t be explained, it won’t get used (or sold).\nTo help unpick this issue, some useful research questions spring to mind.\nDIFFERENTIATION\n\nWhy would you use this thing over the 10+ other things that perform similar functions?\n\nMASTERY\n\nWhat is the 1 best thing about this product?\nWhat does it do that you can’t do with anything else?\n\nFIRST IMPRESSION\n\nWhat 3 words come to mind after initially seeing the service or brand?\nWho do you think would create a thing like this? (i.e. white-label testing)\n\nEXPERIENCE DELIGHT\n\nHow did you feel while going through the journey?\n\nRECALL & VIRAL EFFECTS\n\nHow would you describe the thing to a friend?\nWhat would you type in search to find this thing?\n\nCONVERSION & RETENTION\n\nWould you swap your current one for this one?\nWould you come back to the service tomorrow? Why?\n\nRESOURCEFULNESS & PRODUCTIVITY\n\nWhat would you do with the money/time you saved by using this product?\n\nFrom working previously with start-ups, entrepreneurs and blue chip clients for several years to evaluate markets, test concepts, optimise and promote their services I realised the products & teams that survived, grew, or got funding typically had similar traits:\n\na strong value proposition, product market fit, a sense of purpose, and a compelling story.\n\nIn commercial spaces this type of information is typically communicated through landing pages. We know these are robustly built using keyword discovery and conversion testing.\nIn the public sector transaction space most service landing pages are instructional with a big “Start now” button. Value proposition and descriptive information is rarely considered appropriate.\nIn a pure transactional space where there is no alternative, e.g. license renewal, people just want to find a task and get it done then that’s fine\nIn sectors such as the NHS where many platforms and services (central, regional, local, etc) are vying for the same users, then value proposition becomes really important.\nWhy would a hospital use this supplier over the other supplier? Is it worth using the centralised systems that are good but not perfect vs. spending millions on custom builds? Why would a patient use a health app when there are 10,000 other health apps?\nIn the start-up world if there is an unclear need or weak value proposition, this usually equates to none-startup, or launch followed by graduate-decline, or outright failure.\nIn my opinion, gentrification of digital services is a risky double-edged-sword. While making things consistent can reduce time to build a thing and increase the success rates for tasks, it could slow down product adoption.\nI’m surprised when it comes to service landing pages that the commercially-savvy Product Managers and the communications leads aren’t pushing for value-focused messaging and targeted advertising (over generic national campaigns) as these are shown to improve the experience, improve adoption rates, aid retention and likelihood to recommend.\nThere are many great things happening in the public sector digital space, but we’re still playing catch-up in terms of understanding how best to communicate the value and drive adoption for various services and platforms we create."

    "text": "I did my bit\nTo consider challenging feedback from patients we can “zoom out a bit” and consider the users and actors involved in the whole journey…\nIn the scenario below every user thinks they are doing their “bit” in the “process”. Everyone is working to the best of their ability, given their landscape, limited time and resources they have. For example:\nNational appointment booking line — “There are no slots at the service. We can send a request for the service to arrange an appointment, or you can call back tomorrow.”\nHospital booking / call centre — “You are already on the waiting list for an appointment. We can’t see you any quicker. You can try again tomorrow for a cancellation?”\nHospital clinical triage — “We’ve reviewed your referral letter. It is not urgent we’ve got an 18 week target for Referral to Treatment. It has only been five weeks so we’ve got time… our other patients need to go first.”\nPharmacy — “We put you on a highest dose of the recomended prescription. We could try a different mix but those meds are sub-optimal.”\nGP — “I’ve referred you to the right speciality — there are no other local choices.”\nCommissioner — “We need to cut the costs in the area so we block commissioned. We don’t want to have local restrictions but we must optimise local resourcing within our budget. You can go to another service but we tell GPs to use this service first.”\nPrivate providers — “We have some capacity… but if you apply for funding it’s unlikely to get approved. Or you could pay.”\nNHS 111 — “We’ve assessed you but you need to go back to your GP and pharmacy as it’s a long term condition — you’re already in their system. If your symptoms suggest it’s an emergency we would arrange an ambulance.”\nSystem supplier — “Patients can always raise a complaint… but we provide IT and that is working fine. We don’t provide direct healthcare. If a patient thinks there is a bug they contact the service desk. If we confirm a bug we fix it under the Service Level Agreement.”\nOnline survey — “This is an automated monitoring service we don’t respond to individual comments.”\nResearch team — “These patient comments are upsetting, yes. The patient is angry too. Yet their situation is the same as thousands of other patients waiting for appointments. We see comments like this all the time and if their comments suggest a specific risk of harm we send it to a clinician.”\nThe time that is needed say “I’m sorry, I can’t help, please follow this process” is small to each actor. Allthe actors get paid for their part in the agreed process, and they also get a little drop of happiness by “nudging the patient along in the right direction”.\nThe consequences of this process for the patient is a complete timesink navigating various silos, it can make patients lose trust in the NHS.\nIf a patient condition starts to deteriorate, how will the patient know who to reach out to? It may feel as though no one is managing their care and there is a real risk they fall through gaps in provision.\nIf a patient deteriorates and they need an ambulance or they end up at Accident & Emergency… the fact they have a referral and have booked an appointment with a specialist doesn’t matter."
