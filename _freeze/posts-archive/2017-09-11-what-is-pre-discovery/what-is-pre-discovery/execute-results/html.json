It should underpin the User Research Discovery themes and will make a big difference to the users approached and the questions asked during Discovery.\n\n**Teams with an existing service will have questions such as:**\n\n* How frequently is our service currently used?\n* What is the demographic of the current user base?\n* What have our users already told us about the current product?\n* What are users pain points?\n* What do users do before arriving in our service?\n* What do users do after using our service?\n* What are the main outcomes from using our service?\n\nTeams should list out the many dozens of questions they may need to answer through Discovery and then assess whether any internal data sources will answer this before kicking off new research.\n\n### Why more Pre-Discovery is helpful\n\nDiscovery is a awesome, challenging and rewarding too. Meeting users, getting immersed in their environment, understanding nuances in their needs. But Discovery is expensive and time consuming so we need to do try and answer questions effectively, in a targeted way.\n\n# Here is my Pre-Discovery checklist:\n* Review all previous research reports and surveys to identify relevant insight about a thing\n* Speak to service desk and review a sample of relevant service tickets\n* Review analytics and performance data for the thing\n* Review business case and benefits case for the thing, to see what benefits we expect users will see\n* Run a quick session with Product, Sales or Implementation team to understand if there is knowledge or previous evidence about the thing\n* Highlight in a service map where the thing sits in relation to other things\n* Evaluate the benefits of fixing the thing\n\n**Teams may say these activities should just happen in Discovery…**\n\nWhile *possibly* true, most teams need to raise funding to pursue Discovery research and delivery projects and Pre-Discovery may be helpful to flesh out the business case and specify some problems to solve.\n\n**Gathering user research evidence for benefits early sets in motion good practice that should be continued through Discovery and Alpha.** This also can help a team quickly surface all the key issues whether they need further understanding.\n\nGathering this data during Pre-Discovery won’t help you to confirm user needs, you will still need depth Discovery research. It also won’t help you identify the best solution, you will also need Alpha research and iterative design .\n\n### More benefits of Pre-Discovery\n\nPre-Discovery gives researchers some time to start thinking about finding the right users and starting recruitment so there is a seamless transition into Discovery when an Agile team may scale out and exploratory research and technical work really kicks off in earnest.\n\nPre-Discovery usually involves a limited number of roles too. A User Researcher, UX Designer, Service Designer and Business Analyst. It can take a few days to a few weeks to gather relevant insights.\n\n### Getting buy in for your Pre-Discovery \n\nShare your Pre-Discovery evidence with key stakeholders and sponsors, to answer the question 'What do we know?', 'What else do we need to know?' and why should we buy into continue into Discovery phasee?\nGive them a flavour of the future: how will their world be better when they know more about how to solve a thing?\n\n**Keeping momentum going**\n\nIf more business cases were based on User Needs and Pre-Discovery evidence with further staged funding towards the end of Discovery/Alpha, there would surely be a lot less disappointment for users and stakeholders when product launches go awry. Less feature commitments will be promised that are later abandoned quietly during Discovery or Alpha, and importantly less irrelevant and implausible features will continue through to live service deployment.\n\nGetting started with UR projects isn’t always easy — Chicken or egg first? How do you complete a Pre-Discovery on the thing without funding or resources? \n\nBreaking the cycle is challenging especially when most teams might already at capacity with their existing commitments.\n\nInnovative organisations embed Pre-Discovery into their standard process for Strategy, Policy and Product. This support alignment at all levels to ensure outcomes are based on both user needs, and business needs.\n\n# How did your Pre-Discovery go?\n\nIf you found this post interesting or useful please comment below :) it would be great to hear your stories of Pre-Discovery!!\n\n",
