Thanks for visiting my blog!\nSo my kids are always asking me “Daddy what do you do for work?” well that’s a difficult question and I tried to explain this to them on several occasions…\nI lead and manage the research in multidisciplinary product teams. I enable teams to deliver excellent solutions and services to market by starting with user needs, working in iterative development and validating concepts with users and business.\nI think this was just a bit too much for them to take in… so I thought it might help to have a space to shareand reflect, maybe I would learn a things along the way too!!\nI really really enjoy working in UX. Over the past 15 years I have been very lucky to work with a lot of fabulous product teams and start-ups and through research I’ve able to help them find their purpose, grow, making positive strides forward.\nHaving my own blog really helped me learn about UX, research tools and provided space to test new things; before recommending them as an approach for ‘the real projects’ at work."

It does help a lot with keeping focussed and finding areas for improvement!!\nSend anonymous feedback to Tom: https://bit.ly/Tom360\nHere is sample of the feedback I received from colleagues in the past few years:\n• “Very passionate, great at organising things and providing insights to the team quickly”\n• “Tom’s expertise in research and research methodologies have helped shape the programmes future development. Specifically, the redesigning and streamlining of key workflows within the referral journey. Tom’s outputs have included key findings on prototype user research, analysis on user behaviour and traits, as well as investigations into processes and business needs.”\n• “Influences change in the product that benefits the user, gives the users a legitimate voice when discussing the product and the design of it, gathers a lot of insights that are useful for influencing design”\n• “He set up the whole of the antigen testing user research programme by himself in a very short space of time. It is an incredible achievement and it is mostly thanks to him that we are where we are right now.”\n• “Excellent research planning, research execution, research findings analysis and high-quality presentations of research findings”\n• “Significant improvements to research efficiency, highly detailed and thorough research outputs, deep thinking on ways of working.”\n• “Tom consistently remains focused on the users needs. He remains empathetic to their situation and is vital in bringing perspective to the discussion when the team requires it.”\n• “Hard working, has a large range of knowledge areas, very good at putting in to action ideas, very good at Qualtrics, very good at using Jira, very good at developing research plans, presents findings back well”\n• “He is very hardworking and dedicated to doing good work that will yield impactful results. He can both work on the ground and think strategically.”\n• “Commitment to UCD ways of working, persistence in solving problems and finding insights, ability to take very complex information and understand it quickly, ability to get the most from tools such as Qualtrics.

    "text": "Some positive news\n\n\nWe’ve been working hard to increase awareness of the User Centred-Design Maturity Model, Self-Review Workshops, and Community of Practice. Things were abit slow over the summer months, but gradually things really started to take off. A few larger teams are super keen and booked in lots of workshops, and rightly so some of our teams are skeptical “what another 3 hour workshop?” It does take a while to build up trust and explain the benefits. It is not for our UCD leaders and workshop faciliators to push for workshops too hard, we take a coaching approach and the tool is a self-review process… the evidence of impact can be heard loudly from the great feedback from teams have taken part about the positive changes it has supported them to make.\nThe ‘Reseaarch Panels Best Practice’ workstream is starting to deliver positive outcomes. We’ve designed new way of communicating and recruiting healthcare staff and “professional users”. A pilot has been completed with over 50 staff signing up for the new panel. We’re next working on a comms plan to roll out the service for all our researchers shortly!\nAnti-Racism Allies training - this training (run by HEE) got me reflecting quite deeply on my own personal history and where I grew up. There were some really nice people on the course. Note all the course attendees were white managers from the NHS and our cohort will meet up during 6-month programme. I’m hopeful that I can learn more about myself, gain some wider perspectives, and understand how I can be a better ally in the future.\n\n\nChallenges and puzzles this week\n\n\nTaking on way too much. Our UCD-Ops team is really small, there are so many teams that need help and the problems are often very complex. I really really (really really) enjoy helping people and it gives a great boost when we hear positive feedback from colleagues after helping them, we just want to help more. However, I realise that by helping people all the time it can be a burden on myself, and the team. We’ve talked about pushing back more and what can we do to ensure everyone gets a fair amount of help and they become self-sufficient. We’re looking at ways our team can better signpost help to reduce the number of repeated request."

    "text": "Some positive news\n\n\nThe Leeds User Research Lab. Everything is in place to launch this venue for our colleagues to use very soon. It has been a real long road, with so many hurdles to overcome; it was quite an emotional time when we received our training and supplier handover last week. This week I visited again to test out everything we learnt, I plugged in all the equipment and clicked the ‘Start’, ‘Record’ and ‘Go Live’ buttons on the controls. Everything worked as anticipated such a relief!\nBehind the scenes we’ve been ‘doing the hard work’ on our Knowledge Management/Documentation/Policies to support our teams and colleagues during the merger. These resources will help ensure things aren’t lost in transmission but also supports scalability as the organisations align. We’re always looking to collaborate and if teams have resources they can happily feed them into our documentation process.\nMeeting a key supplier. We’ve been working together remotely for many years, so it was great to finally meet the supplier for a brief chat in Leeds and share more about the context in which we work and opportunities to improve the relationship between our researchers and support teams.\n\n\nChallenges and puzzles this week\n\n\nI was super busy over half-term with family and work. I’ve booked 3 days off to repair my mental health and tidy up some things. I’ve personally been through some difficult times during the past few years; I’m not sure I have the mental capacity to go deep thinking at this time. It is so much pressure just to be a good adult role model for 2 kids every day, and run a tight ship; my own needs are to relax, enjoy life and learn how to build trust in people again.\nCoping with a recent loss in the family."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Image: Daniel Lerman\n\n\n\nPre-Discovery is a thing.\n\nI’ve been asked about: “What is a Pre-Discovery”?\n\nPre-Discovery is helpful for teams working on existing products and services where data can be gathered from internal resources. It should underpin the User Research Discovery themes and will make a big difference to the users approached and the questions asked during Discovery.\nTeams with an existing service will have questions such as:\n\nHow frequently is our service currently used?\nWhat is the demographic of the current user base?\nWhat have our users already told us about the current product?\nWhat are users pain points?\nWhat do users do before arriving in our service?\nWhat do users do after using our service?\nWhat are the main outcomes from using our service?\n\nTeams should list out the many dozens of questions they may need to answer through Discovery and then assess whether any internal data sources will answer this before kicking off new research.\n\nWhy more Pre-Discovery is helpful\nDiscovery is a awesome, challenging and rewarding too. Meeting users, getting immersed in their environment, understanding nuances in their needs. But Discovery is expensive and time consuming so we need to do try and answer questions effectively, in a targeted way.\n\n\n\nHere is my Pre-Discovery checklist:\n\nReview all previous research reports and surveys to identify relevant insight about a thing\nSpeak to service desk and review a sample of relevant service tickets\nReview analytics and performance data for the thing\nReview business case and benefits case for the thing, to see what benefits we expect users will see\nRun a quick session with Product, Sales or Implementation team to understand if there is knowledge or previous evidence about the thing\nHighlight in a service map where the thing sits in relation to other things\nEvaluate the benefits of fixing the thing\n\nTeams may say these activities should just happen in Discovery…\nWhile possibly true, most teams need to raise funding to pursue Discovery research and delivery projects and Pre-Discovery may be helpful to flesh out the business case and specify some problems to solve.\nGathering user research evidence for benefits early sets in motion good practice that should be continued through Discovery and Alpha. This also can help a team quickly surface all the key issues whether they need further understanding.\nGathering this data during Pre-Discovery won’t help you to confirm user needs, you will still need depth Discovery research. It also won’t help you identify the best solution, you will also need Alpha research and iterative design .\n\nMore benefits of Pre-Discovery\nPre-Discovery gives researchers some time to start thinking about finding the right users and starting recruitment so there is a seamless transition into Discovery when an Agile team may scale out and exploratory research and technical work really kicks off in earnest.\nPre-Discovery usually involves a limited number of roles too. A User Researcher, UX Designer, Service Designer and Business Analyst. It can take a few days to a few weeks to gather relevant insights.\n\n\nGetting buy in for your Pre-Discovery\nShare your Pre-Discovery evidence with key stakeholders and sponsors, to answer the question ‘What do we know?’, ‘What else do we need to know?’ and why should we buy into continue into Discovery phasee? Give them a flavour of the future: how will their world be better when they know more about how to solve a thing?\nKeeping momentum going\nIf more business cases were based on User Needs and Pre-Discovery evidence with further staged funding towards the end of Discovery/Alpha, there would surely be a lot less disappointment for users and stakeholders when product launches go awry. Less feature commitments will be promised that are later abandoned quietly during Discovery or Alpha, and importantly less irrelevant and implausible features will continue through to live service deployment.\nGetting started with UR projects isn’t always easy — Chicken or egg first? How do you complete a Pre-Discovery on the thing without funding or resources?\nBreaking the cycle is challenging especially when most teams might already at capacity with their existing commitments.\nInnovative organisations embed Pre-Discovery into their standard process for Strategy, Policy and Product. This support alignment at all levels to ensure outcomes are based on both user needs, and business needs.\n\n\n\nHow did your Pre-Discovery go?\nIf you found this post interesting or useful please comment below :) it would be great to hear your stories of Pre-Discovery!!"

    "text": "Reply\nReally interesting question. I’ve not seen any formal guidance on it –\nI guess my answer would be yes it varies between services. Big enough so you can get some useful insight and Small enough that it is low key and no one notices if you have to pull it?\nThe last thing you want for your ‘Private Beta’ service is to spend ages setting up a private beta panel/community only to not have enough users going through to gain any useful insight, this would be very expensive means of testing and validating a thing\nFor the new NHS Manage Your Referral Service (part of NHS e-Referral Service). We ran a very very small public beta. The old national service has around 1 million transactions per year, we used a tiny link on the homepage of the old service to redirect about 1% of users, we later made a more prominent link which redirected about 10%.\nWe had (for a few months) only a few dozen users per day — around 10% provided survey feedback (5–10 users per day) but the survey and analytics base sizes weren’t robust enough to say if it was statistically an improvement (e.g. Satisfaction/completion rate) over an old service it was due to replace — was this just by chance due to low sample and high margin of error.\nWhat you can do though with only a few users is analyse individual users and see why people drop off and the errors and make some informed changes based on analytics / database queries, that needs to be part of the private or public beta plan. Until you scale up you won’t know for sure if the private beta data is robust and the service is cooking on gas as many weird errors/alternative use cases that you won’t find in private beta testing are much less likely to occur with only a handful of users!\nI guess it comes back to your service, questions for the PO and UR to think about might be:\n\nwhat are the objectives are for private beta?\nwhat is the means for validating incremental improvements?\nis there is a drive/need to go for public beta?\nhow many changes are you planning to test? as you will need much larger numbers e.g. if using AB or multi variate testing,\nhow quickly can the team resolve issues/make changes?\nwhen should we scale up? how long will it take to gather * data to validate that it works?\n\nHope this helps!\nTom"

    "title": "Product People - When stakeholders attack!",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Great Logo: When Stakeholders Attack!\n\n\n\nWhy did I go?\nAs a User Researcher working in the NHS, it seems every project I have been involved in over 4 years has had ample stakeholders (internal and external) lobbying to influence the direction whether that is during planning, discovery research, design or delivery stages.\nEveryone seems to hold an opinion, on everything — all the time, opinion-based-judgement seems to disrupt the evidence-based process of identifying the right problem to solve and finding the best solution.\nThese experiences lead me to snap-up a ticket to the first Product People Midlands event. I was really impressed and excited to see an interesting event like this happening outside of London.\n\n\nWhat was this event about?\nAptly named ‘When stakeholders attack’ the meet-up set off with friendly words from the host Si Manby (ManbySi)and the event didn’t disappoint following that.\nThis was a great no-holds-barred think-out-loud debate about the major challenges facing many Product Managers and Product Teams across departments.\nThe presenters focused on re-occurring problem areas and each brought a key quotes to start their talk and discussion:\nKaz Hufton (@Kaz_H_666)\n \nThe talk focused on evidence of a fundamental misunderstanding of what “discovery” means,\n“every time I do a project I have to explain what a discovery is, and why we are doing it, to the same people. Like 68 times.”\n“It took me a year to realise what we were doing was based on a ‘Solution Definition’ and ‘Project Initiation’ documents that was written by one person and was based solely on their assumptions. The discovery stage was merely the first stage clearly marked out on their waterfall chart.”\nAlice Cudmore (@alice_cudmore)\n\nA great quote — probably the most over-used phrase I’ve heard.\n\nTo counter this question, there are suggestions around asking “why do you need to know”. Inevitably this would unpack a whole host of internal problems around fixation on timelines and milestone tracking, money, internal politics, resourcing problems, scope creep, and yes, more money.\n\n\n“Somehow there is no realisation when someone leaves you can’t just drop-ship in a new person with identical skills and experience; that the delivery of stuff is going to slow down.” Lauren Tombs (@TombsLauren)\n\n\nThe talk focused on product owners experiences of actually being empowered to decide things, but this constrained by excessive stakeholder requirements at the expense of user needs, usability, deliver-ability, and perhaps even common sense.\nSome great examples and it seems some projects have really tried every different stakeholder engagement approach to getting around this barrier,\nOne thought from from the floor… “If stakeholders want to block a project they will, can anything be done?”\n\n\nWhat else was discussed?\nThe session was 50%-masterclass, 50%-peer-therapy.\nThose attending added some quality case studies too from their vast years of product experience too.\nThe discussions touched on many broader problems within departments,\n\nBureaucratic internal approvals and support (e.g. procurement) processes,\nLack of trust and empowerment in teams,\nDocuments for the sake of documents, even when it is never read,\nLack of vision and intent from senior management,\nLessons not being learned time and again.\n\n\n\nSo who else attended?\nWell you may or may not know them, but if you work with them you have probably heard them. They are often noisey, nosey, confrontational perhaps, contrarians yes, asking lots of awkward questions yes, blunt yes, rude — perhaps? Still can’t find them.. Look for a person not wearing a blue or grey suit. Possibly a T-shirt.\n\nChallengers to say the least. Yes, these are the Product People — an emerging force of thinkers, doers, realists, persuaders who have are massively passionate about what they do and have a full grasp of their users, the business and technology.\n\nThose Product Managers, Product Leads, Senior Product Owners are seemingly doing a lot of hard work to put whimsically-flimsey ideas through their paces and deliver stuff of actual end-user value and quality for organisations.\nOne experienced manager was asked how they should decide who internally would a suitable for that role,\n“Look at your department and pick the people who are asking the most awkward questions.”\nAnother speaker noted “Problems were occurring on several projects as the previous Product Manager was saying yes to everyone’s requests without thinking.”\n“If you’re not saying No and upsetting someone most weeks you’re probably not doing it right.”\nProduct managers seem to be routinely confused with project managers, delivery managers, and service owner roles. Bizarrely, as pointed out, these Product Managers are set objectives and assessed on delivering value, however this often flies in direct conflict with colleagues whose objectives are set to deliver specific features.\nSome debate occurred around a perception that the role of GDS as a “referee of quality” and “stick to wave” it’s is not functioning as well as it previously as a central function, with formal assessments. People just ignore the User needs bit and skip into design, the Product managers are being asked whats the minimum they could do to pass the assessment.\nAlso, questions surrounded the role “Service Manager” while that started with a good intention, it could have become diluted and confused to the point it is almost meaningless.\n\n\nWhat was the event like?\nWell the story unfolded fast, but not like the David and Goliath where a simple slingshot brings a giant to it’s knee.\nNo this was something else, much akin to the Resistance vs. the First Order in the Star Wars Last Jedi. The unyielding, unmerciful, crushing, gripping nature of the order on the product community working across departments was pretty clear.\n\nHowever, from the resistance side it wasn’t all poke-fun at Mr Blobby and the order, as that’s easily done. The discussions were tempered with empathy with the group considering the other side of the coin too… interesting questions were raised like:\n“What might be motivating stakeholders and organisations to put in place these constraints?”,\n“Why are they risk averse?”, “Why do they oppose change?”,\n“Can transformation really be complete if they (..read the staff..) oppose all change?”,\n“Why would people who benefit from hierarchy for 20 years or more want to empower their teams?”.\n\n\nMy thoughts following the event\nThe strange thing to me, in this story about products an delivery life-cycles, ironically and sadly the ‘product community’ are cast as the pantomime villains.\nThe collective insight, expertise and experience at the meet was shocking… shocking in the sense that such a group who clearly have huge talent and can add so much value to organisations have had to suffer so many battle scars and have so many ridiculous tales to tell. Why do organisations not learn from past mistakes?\nWhat with it being 2019, I’m not sure whether it was reassuring or concerning to learn these problems exist and seem consistent across departments.\nThe answers during the discussion were considered, and the situation seems vastly complex, so it’s not surprising that any transformation across departments is hard to start and even harder to make stick.\nOne point felt clear. Between the old and new ways of doing things, it seems like stalemate. On both sides now and this results in ignoring or ridiculing, rather than trying to find any solution.\nLack of user-centered and product-focus, probably means that many times things are being built based on assumptions; opportunities are likely to be missed too and delivery is not always going to succeed.\nMy question to readers would be ‘Should Product Management and following user-centered design still be considered a movement, or is that seen as best practice, and — in essence — the new norm?’\n\n\nTL;DR\nThe Product People community is growing and maturing. Be aware, boo is coming to a goose near you.\nThis was a great event in the Midlands, even when the group skimmed the stone across the top of the lake, rather than just focusing on the topic ‘When Stakeholders Attack’ there was really interesting, thoughtful discussion and banter.\nWould I go to the next Product People midlands event? 5 stars yes for sure. There are so many important topics to explore that I only hope there are more events like this (outside London).\nWell that’s my take out anyway :)"

Somewhere in the middle of Discovery and Alpha often things get lost and stuff gets released without initially exploring if the team are creating a strong value proposition.\nCan this new thing be described succinctly in a way that is appealing and effectively communicates why people should use the new product / service / feature. If it can’t be explained, it won’t get used (or sold).\nTo help unpick this issue, some useful research questions spring to mind.\nDIFFERENTIATION\n\nWhy would you use this thing over the 10+ other things that perform similar functions?\n\nMASTERY\n\nWhat is the 1 best thing about this product?\nWhat does it do that you can’t do with anything else?\n\nFIRST IMPRESSION\n\nWhat 3 words come to mind after initially seeing the service or brand?\nWho do you think would create a thing like this?

We know these are robustly built using keyword discovery and conversion testing.\nIn the public sector transaction space most service landing pages are instructional with a big “Start now” button. Value proposition and descriptive information is rarely considered appropriate.\nIn a pure transactional space where there is no alternative, e.g. license renewal, people just want to find a task and get it done then that’s fine\nIn sectors such as the NHS where many platforms and services (central, regional, local, etc) are vying for the same users, then value proposition becomes really important.\nWhy would a hospital use this supplier over the other supplier? Is it worth using the centralised systems that are good but not perfect vs. spending millions on custom builds? Why would a patient use a health app when there are 10,000 other health apps?\nIn the start-up world if there is an unclear need or weak value proposition, this usually equates to none-startup, or launch followed by graduate-decline, or outright failure.\nIn my opinion, gentrification of digital services is a risky double-edged-sword. While making things consistent can reduce time to build a thing and increase the success rates for tasks, it could slow down product adoption.\nI’m surprised when it comes to service landing pages that the commercially-savvy Product Managers and the communications leads aren’t pushing for value-focused messaging and targeted advertising (over generic national campaigns) as these are shown to improve the experience, improve adoption rates, aid retention and likelihood to recommend.\nThere are many great things happening in the public sector digital space, but we’re still playing catch-up in terms of understanding how best to communicate the value and drive adoption for various services and platforms we create."

With the redesign work happening this year we need to find solutions that work for the majority use cases (i.e. Red Routes), not break all the designs to continue supporting local initiatives and workarounds.\nAll interesting challenges to be working on; how do you measure success when you aren’t just testing ease of use, you’re testing against variations in local and national policy, business process, automation process and general reluctance to change.\nTo have any chance of making things better, and to improve the overall experience, ultimately the service needs to reduce the number workarounds in place.\n\nTL;DR\n\n“Not all users are going to be happy with all the changes all the time.”"

    "text": "I did my bit\nTo consider challenging feedback from patients we can “zoom out a bit” and consider the users and actors involved in the whole journey…\nIn the scenario below every user thinks they are doing their “bit” in the “process”. Everyone is working to the best of their ability, given their landscape, limited time and resources they have. For example:\nNational appointment booking line — “There are no slots at the service. We can send a request for the service to arrange an appointment, or you can call back tomorrow.”\nHospital booking / call centre — “You are already on the waiting list for an appointment. We can’t see you any quicker. You can try again tomorrow for a cancellation?”\nHospital clinical triage — “We’ve reviewed your referral letter. It is not urgent we’ve got an 18 week target for Referral to Treatment. It has only been five weeks so we’ve got time… our other patients need to go first.”\nPharmacy — “We put you on a highest dose of the recomended prescription. We could try a different mix but those meds are sub-optimal.”\nGP — “I’ve referred you to the right speciality — there are no other local choices.”\nCommissioner — “We need to cut the costs in the area so we block commissioned. We don’t want to have local restrictions but we must optimise local resourcing within our budget. You can go to another service but we tell GPs to use this service first.”\nPrivate providers — “We have some capacity… but if you apply for funding it’s unlikely to get approved. Or you could pay.”\nNHS 111 — “We’ve assessed you but you need to go back to your GP and pharmacy as it’s a long term condition — you’re already in their system. If your symptoms suggest it’s an emergency we would arrange an ambulance.”\nSystem supplier — “Patients can always raise a complaint… but we provide IT and that is working fine. We don’t provide direct healthcare. If a patient thinks there is a bug they contact the service desk. If we confirm a bug we fix it under the Service Level Agreement.”\nOnline survey — “This is an automated monitoring service we don’t respond to individual comments.”\nResearch team — “These patient comments are upsetting, yes. The patient is angry too. Yet their situation is the same as thousands of other patients waiting for appointments. We see comments like this all the time and if their comments suggest a specific risk of harm we send it to a clinician.”\nThe time that is needed say “I’m sorry, I can’t help, please follow this process” is small to each actor. Allthe actors get paid for their part in the agreed process, and they also get a little drop of happiness by “nudging the patient along in the right direction”.\nThe consequences of this process for the patient is a complete timesink navigating various silos, it can make patients lose trust in the NHS.\nIf a patient condition starts to deteriorate, how will the patient know who to reach out to? It may feel as though no one is managing their care and there is a real risk they fall through gaps in provision.\nIf a patient deteriorates and they need an ambulance or they end up at Accident & Emergency… the fact they have a referral and have booked an appointment with a specialist doesn’t matter."
