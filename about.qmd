Hi, I’m Tom. Thanks for visiting my blog!
 
So my kids are always asking me “Daddy what do you do for work?” well that’s a difficult question and I tried to explain this to them on several occasions…

I lead and manage the research in multidisciplinary product teams. I enable teams to deliver excellent solutions and services to market by starting with user needs, working in iterative development and validating concepts with users and business.

I think this was just a bit too much for them to take in… so I thought it might help to have a space to shareand reflect, maybe I would learn a things along the way too!!

I really really enjoy working in UX. Over the past 15 years I have been very lucky to work with a lot of fabulous product teams and start-ups and through research I've able to help them find their purpose, grow, making positive strides forward.

Having my own blog really helped me learn about UX, research tools and provided space to test new things; before recommending them as an approach for 'the real projects' at work.
