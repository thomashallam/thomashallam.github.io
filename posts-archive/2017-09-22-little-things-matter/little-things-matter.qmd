# Little things matter

Today we found out that a simple change the team made to a patient letter will possibly save the NHS about Â£500k per year!

A benefit like this really helps the team to focus on:

* Quick wins
* Validating change
* Incremental improvements
* Aligning with a long-term vision


All important stuff!
