**Selling your wares** - working in an organisation with low user-centred design maturity and teams where no one knows what you do, how you can fit into the processes, how can you add value to programme work 

**Recruiting users...** Nightmare! Hard to find! Lack of budget!

**Site visits** – Travelling to them, intensive, loads of data, drinking from the fire hose!

**Difficult interviews** – vicarious trauma - mental health challenges

**Cognitive workload** – stress of needing to be impartial and balanced all the time

**Analysis** – intensive, team sport, loads of data, seeing the wood for the trees

**Wearing many UCD hats** – research/product/service/coach/project manager:staffing 

**Difficult stakeholders, managers and sponsors** – 3 types

1. Those lobbying for their opinions to be incorporated at every stage
2. Those impossible to engage, distant, uninterested
3. Those *Questioning everything* – with disbelief or trying to justify out the pain points 

**Challenging stakeholders** who remain committed to  pre-conceived ideas, even as the evidence unfolds

### TL;DR

In what other field (apart from legal) does every statement, suggestion or idea come under such scrutiny??

Sorry for the rant this was a hectic/difficult day/week!
