This month I've mainly been focussing on the UCD AI policy and guidance - below is the process I followed to create and launch the UCD AI Hub.

## Problems to address

* Different professions working on overlapping guidance; we need consistent principles and guidnce for research and design.
* Different professions are moving at different speeds with regards to learning about and adopting AI
* There is a lot of shadow-ai usage happening, we need safe spaces and processes to help bring forward discussions
* We need to confirm what are the red-lines that cannot be crossed with use of AI tools


## How I managed the project

Here is how I approached of redesigning the AI policy and guidance, working from the central team and inclusively facilitating the process with colleagues from across the wider profession.

### Week 1

- I host our Knowledge Management Group, every fortnight we review proposed changes to the UCD Centre of Expertise. This week we reviewed the "Prototyping with AI" guidance and provided feedback on Mural
- The next priority was getting stakeholder agreement, to the principle that we need to align two pieces of conflicting / overlapping guidance. 
- I proposed a new high-level information architecture and sought feedback from stakeholders, including the Head of Design and the UR for AI Working Group. Both were supportive of aligning.

## Week 2:

- Next I drafted structure and content for UCD AI Hub, incorporating guidance for UR AI and Design for AI, 
- Align to recently released corporate standards on AI
- Use allowed AI tools (Copilot) to quality assure the drafted guidance (spelling, grammar, conisistency, tone, duplication)
- Set up a new 'Prompt Library' within the Centre of Expertise
- Sought a 2nd round of feedback from AI for UR working group, as well key stakeholders including Heads of Research, Design and Content.

## Week 3:

- Finalise content, adding training events, checking all links, adding more documents and resources
- Populated the AI Prompt Library with 10 prompts as a starting point.
- Published the new policy guidance on Sharepoint
- Shared on Slack for further feedback from Content Design community - currently placeholder page that is blocked until workshop in March
- Presented to User Research community
- Drafted comms for rollout, with support of Copilot.

## Week 4:

- Final changes / content additions on the site based on UR Community feedback.
- Send out email to all 400+ UCD Staff confirming the policy and guidance in now Live.

And monitor... this policy guidance will need to continue to evolve as teams conduct AI experiments and learn about more what works and what doesn't within the NHS. 

Sending a big thank you to colleagues across multiple teams and services who provided multiple rounds of feedback. 

The new policy is really critical in clarifying the direction and what teams can and can't use AI for in NHSE. Test and Learn, within organisaitonal safeguards.

Alongside this, it has also been a big-month for other projects. 

* UR Finder hit 450 reports - nearly double from two months ago
* CPS (MS) expert team are starting next week to support development of our Copilot agent
* UR Lab training sessions completed, with great feedback from colleagues
* And lots of BAU, including new joiners.
