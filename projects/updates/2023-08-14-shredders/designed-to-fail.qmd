# DIY doesn't always work
 
![The missing key?](designed-to-fail.jpg)

You may be wondering, what this photo is all about?

Well I’ll let you know to save you guessing, and also avoiding a Very Frustrating Sticky Mess.

Companies are building failure into their products so customers have to dispose of their purchased goods sooner than needed

Here is a example, the internal cutting component from a document shredder (a well known brand!)


## Two missing washers are key!

1. **It is Designed to Fail.** If you put 1 or 2 extra paper sheets in then the gears may buckle. The plastic housing bends over time and the metal cutters jump off the plastic guardrail. When the 6 loose metal cutters lock up, the motor may burn out

2. **The design makes it (nearly) impossible to repair and reassemble**. You would have to take the whole thing apart, get covered in mechanical grease and paper cuttings, yuck! remove all the grease and try to rebuild it. I tried it for say 2 hours, and it still wouldn’t work. Probably needed a special aligner tool as well as other electrical testing devices. Repair is not worth the hassle for a £50 appliance

Any way, designing products to fail like this is really bad for the environment! plastic is not a sustainable choice and the whole product now ends up in landfill or shipped as international ewaste, because what… 2 x little washers (@ ~1p each?)

So next time you go to shred something and it says ‘max 3 sheets’, please save yourself (and the environment) some aggro and just shred 1 sheet at a time!

We need companies to start thinking of the environment when we design, how can we make a things last years? Not just a few months!
