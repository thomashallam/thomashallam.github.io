    "text": "Hi, I’m Tom. Thanks for visiting my blog!\nSo my kids are always asking me “Daddy what do you do for work?” well that’s a difficult question and I tried to explain this to them on several occasions…\nI lead and manage the research in multidisciplinary product teams. I enable teams to deliver excellent solutions and services to market by starting with user needs, working in iterative development and validating concepts with users and business.\nI think this was just a bit too much for them to take in… so I thought it might help to have a space to shareand reflect, maybe I would learn a things along the way too!!\nI really really enjoy working in UX. Over the past 15 years I have been very lucky to work with a lot of fabulous product teams and start-ups and through research I’ve able to help them find their purpose, grow, making positive strides forward.\nHaving my own blog really helped me learn about UX, research tools and provided space to test new things; before recommending them as an approach for ‘the real projects’ at work."

It does help a lot with keeping focussed and finding areas for improvement!!\nSend anonymous feedback to Tom: https://bit.ly/Tom360\nHere is sample of the feedback I received from colleagues in the past few years:\n• “Very passionate, great at organising things and providing insights to the team quickly”\n• “Tom’s expertise in research and research methodologies have helped shape the programmes future development. Specifically, the redesigning and streamlining of key workflows within the referral journey. Tom’s outputs have included key findings on prototype user research, analysis on user behaviour and traits, as well as investigations into processes and business needs.”\n• “Influences change in the product that benefits the user, gives the users a legitimate voice when discussing the product and the design of it, gathers a lot of insights that are useful for influencing design”\n• “He set up the whole of the antigen testing user research programme by himself in a very short space of time. It is an incredible achievement and it is mostly thanks to him that we are where we are right now.”\n• “Excellent research planning, research execution, research findings analysis and high-quality presentations of research findings”\n• “Significant improvements to research efficiency, highly detailed and thorough research outputs, deep thinking on ways of working.”\n• “Tom consistently remains focused on the users needs. He remains empathetic to their situation and is vital in bringing perspective to the discussion when the team requires it.”\n• “Hard working, has a large range of knowledge areas, very good at putting in to action ideas, very good at Qualtrics, very good at using Jira, very good at developing research plans, presents findings back well”\n• “He is very hardworking and dedicated to doing good work that will yield impactful results. He can both work on the ground and think strategically.”\n• “Commitment to UCD ways of working, persistence in solving problems and finding insights, ability to take very complex information and understand it quickly, ability to get the most from tools such as Qualtrics. Tom’s deep subject knowledge and facility with tech is a significant asset to any team.”\n• “Large amounts of detailed information Identification of issues”"

Welcome!\nI’ve decided to close down my previous projects due to several things: ongoing hack attempts, increasing hosting costs, reduced time to manage servers. Using Wordpress for 10 years I’ve learn so much about websites/cloud/apps/dev/data/security, however for my blog i’ve decided the needs are quite simple so using Quarto is a good way to go.\nI’ll gradually be migrating some of the content over from my old blog and Medium. This will continue to be a space where I share how things are going for me, at work and outside"

    "text": "Some positive news\n\n\nWe’ve been working hard to increase awareness of the User Centred-Design Maturity Model, Self-Review Workshops, and Community of Practice. Things were abit slow over the summer months, but gradually things really started to take off. A few larger teams are super keen and booked in lots of workshops, and rightly so some of our teams are skeptical “what another 3 hour workshop?” It does take a while to build up trust and explain the benefits. It is not for our UCD leaders and workshop faciliators to push for workshops too hard, we take a coaching approach and the tool is a self-review process… the evidence of impact can be heard loudly from the great feedback from teams have taken part about the positive changes it has supported them to make.\nThe ‘Reseaarch Panels Best Practice’ workstream is starting to deliver positive outcomes. We’ve designed new way of communicating and recruiting healthcare staff and “professional users”. A pilot has been completed with over 50 staff signing up for the new panel. We’re next working on a comms plan to roll out the service for all our researchers shortly!\nAnti-Racism Allies training - this training (run by HEE) got me reflecting quite deeply on my own personal history and where I grew up. There were some really nice people on the course. Note all the course attendees were white managers from the NHS and our cohort will meet up during 6-month programme. I’m hopeful that I can learn more about myself, gain some wider perspectives, and understand how I can be a better ally in the future.\n\n\nChallenges and puzzles this week\n\n\nTaking on way too much. Our UCD-Ops team is really small, there are so many teams that need help and the problems are often very complex. I really really (really really) enjoy helping people and it gives a great boost when we hear positive feedback from colleagues after helping them, we just want to help more. However, I realise that by helping people all the time it can be a burden on myself, and the team. We’ve talked about pushing back more and what can we do to ensure everyone gets a fair amount of help and they become self-sufficient. We’re looking at ways our team can better signpost help to reduce the number of repeated request."

    "text": "Some positive news\n\n\nThe Leeds User Research Lab. Everything is in place to launch this venue for our colleagues to use very soon. It has been a real long road, with so many hurdles to overcome; it was quite an emotional time when we received our training and supplier handover last week. This week I visited again to test out everything we learnt, I plugged in all the equipment and clicked the ‘Start’, ‘Record’ and ‘Go Live’ buttons on the controls. Everything worked as anticipated such a relief!\nBehind the scenes we’ve been ‘doing the hard work’ on our Knowledge Management/Documentation/Policies to support our teams and colleagues during the merger. These resources will help ensure things aren’t lost in transmission but also supports scalability as the organisations align. We’re always looking to collaborate and if teams have resources they can happily feed them into our documentation process.\nMeeting a key supplier. We’ve been working together remotely for many years, so it was great to finally meet the supplier for a brief chat in Leeds and share more about the context in which we work and opportunities to improve the relationship between our researchers and support teams.\n\n\nChallenges and puzzles this week\n\n\nI was super busy over half-term with family and work. I’ve booked 3 days off to repair my mental health and tidy up some things. I’ve personally been through some difficult times during the past few years; I’m not sure I have the mental capacity to go deep thinking at this time. It is so much pressure just to be a good adult role model for 2 kids every day, and run a tight ship; my own needs are to relax, enjoy life and learn how to build trust in people again.\nCoping with a recent loss in the family."

    "text": "Reply\nReally interesting question. I’ve not seen any formal guidance on it –\nI guess my answer would be yes it varies between services. Big enough so you can get some useful insight and Small enough that it is low key and no one notices if you have to pull it?\nThe last thing you want for your ‘Private Beta’ service is to spend ages setting up a private beta panel/community only to not have enough users going through to gain any useful insight, this would be very expensive means of testing and validating a thing\nFor the new NHS Manage Your Referral Service (part of NHS e-Referral Service). We ran a very very small public beta. The old national service has around 1 million transactions per year, we used a tiny link on the homepage of the old service to redirect about 1% of users, we later made a more prominent link which redirected about 10%.\nWe had (for a few months) only a few dozen users per day — around 10% provided survey feedback (5–10 users per day) but the survey and analytics base sizes weren’t robust enough to say if it was statistically an improvement (e.g. Satisfaction/completion rate) over an old service it was due to replace — was this just by chance due to low sample and high margin of error.\nWhat you can do though with only a few users is analyse individual users and see why people drop off and the errors and make some informed changes based on analytics / database queries, that needs to be part of the private or public beta plan. Until you scale up you won’t know for sure if the private beta data is robust and the service is cooking on gas as many weird errors/alternative use cases that you won’t find in private beta testing are much less likely to occur with only a handful of users!\nI guess it comes back to your service, questions for the PO and UR to think about might be:\n\nwhat are the objectives are for private beta?\nwhat is the means for validating incremental improvements?\nis there is a drive/need to go for public beta?\nhow many changes are you planning to test? as you will need much larger numbers e.g. if using AB or multi variate testing,\nhow quickly can the team resolve issues/make changes?\nwhen should we scale up? how long will it take to gather * data to validate that it works?\n\nHope this helps!\nTom"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Image: Daniel Lerman\n\n\n\nPre-Discovery is a thing.\n\nI’ve been asked about: “What is a Pre-Discovery”?\n\nPre-Discovery is helpful for teams working on existing products and services where data can be gathered from internal resources. It should underpin the User Research Discovery themes and will make a big difference to the users approached and the questions asked during Discovery.\nTeams with an existing service will have questions such as:\n\nHow frequently is our service currently used?\nWhat is the demographic of the current user base?\nWhat have our users already told us about the current product?\nWhat are users pain points?\nWhat do users do before arriving in our service?\nWhat do users do after using our service?\nWhat are the main outcomes from using our service?\n\nTeams should list out the many dozens of questions they may need to answer through Discovery and then assess whether any internal data sources will answer this before kicking off new research.\n\nWhy more Pre-Discovery is helpful\nDiscovery is a awesome, challenging and rewarding too. Meeting users, getting immersed in their environment, understanding nuances in their needs. But Discovery is expensive and time consuming so we need to do try and answer questions effectively, in a targeted way.\n\n\n\nHere is my Pre-Discovery checklist:\n\nReview all previous research reports and surveys to identify relevant insight about a thing\nSpeak to service desk and review a sample of relevant service tickets\nReview analytics and performance data for the thing\nReview business case and benefits case for the thing, to see what benefits we expect users will see\nRun a quick session with Product, Sales or Implementation team to understand if there is knowledge or previous evidence about the thing\nHighlight in a service map where the thing sits in relation to other things\nEvaluate the benefits of fixing the thing\n\nTeams may say these activities should just happen in Discovery…\nWhile possibly true, most teams need to raise funding to pursue Discovery research and delivery projects and Pre-Discovery may be helpful to flesh out the business case and specify some problems to solve.\nGathering user research evidence for benefits early sets in motion good practice that should be continued through Discovery and Alpha. This also can help a team quickly surface all the key issues whether they need further understanding.\nGathering this data during Pre-Discovery won’t help you to confirm user needs, you will still need depth Discovery research. It also won’t help you identify the best solution, you will also need Alpha research and iterative design .\n\nMore benefits of Pre-Discovery\nPre-Discovery gives researchers some time to start thinking about finding the right users and starting recruitment so there is a seamless transition into Discovery when an Agile team may scale out and exploratory research and technical work really kicks off in earnest.\nPre-Discovery usually involves a limited number of roles too. A User Researcher, UX Designer, Service Designer and Business Analyst. It can take a few days to a few weeks to gather relevant insights.\n\n\nGetting buy in for your Pre-Discovery\nShare your Pre-Discovery evidence with key stakeholders and sponsors, to answer the question ‘What do we know?’, ‘What else do we need to know?’ and why should we buy into continue into Discovery phasee? Give them a flavour of the future: how will their world be better when they know more about how to solve a thing?\nKeeping momentum going\nIf more business cases were based on User Needs and Pre-Discovery evidence with further staged funding towards the end of Discovery/Alpha, there would surely be a lot less disappointment for users and stakeholders when product launches go awry. Less feature commitments will be promised that are later abandoned quietly during Discovery or Alpha, and importantly less irrelevant and implausible features will continue through to live service deployment.\nGetting started with UR projects isn’t always easy — Chicken or egg first? How do you complete a Pre-Discovery on the thing without funding or resources?\nBreaking the cycle is challenging especially when most teams might already at capacity with their existing commitments.\nInnovative organisations embed Pre-Discovery into their standard process for Strategy, Policy and Product. This support alignment at all levels to ensure outcomes are based on both user needs, and business needs.\n\n\n\nHow did your Pre-Discovery go?\nIf you found this post interesting or useful please comment below :) it would be great to hear your stories of Pre-Discovery!!"
