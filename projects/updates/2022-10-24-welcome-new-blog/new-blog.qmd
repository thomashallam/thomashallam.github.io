<h3>Moving my blog</h3>
This is the first post in my new <a href="https://quarto.org/" target="_blank">Quarto</a> blog. Welcome!

I've decided to close down my previous projects due to several things: ongoing hack attempts, increasing hosting costs, reduced time to manage servers. Using Wordpress for 10 years I've learn so much about websites/cloud/apps/dev/data/security, however for my blog i've decided the needs are quite simple so using Quarto is a good way to go.

I'll gradually be migrating some of the content over from my old blog and Medium. This will continue to be a space where I share how things are going for me, at work and outside

All the comment discussion threads are now powered by the [Giscus App](https://giscus.app/){.external target="_blank"} which is brilliant!

Do share what you would like to hear more about :) 

Thanks for reading

Tom
