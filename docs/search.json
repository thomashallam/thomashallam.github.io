I enable teams to deliver excellent solutions and services to market by starting with user needs, working in iterative development and validating concepts with users and business.\nI think this was just a bit too much for them to take in… so I thought it might help to have a space to shareand reflect, maybe I would learn a things along the way too!!\nI really really enjoy working in UX. Over the past 15 years I have been very lucky to work with a lot of fabulous product teams and start-ups and through research I’ve able to help them find their purpose, grow, making positive strides forward.\nHaving my own blog really helped me learn about UX, research tools and provided space to test new things; before recommending them as an approach for ‘the real projects’ at work."

Specifically, the redesigning and streamlining of key workflows within the referral journey. Tom’s outputs have included key findings on prototype user research, analysis on user behaviour and traits, as well as investigations into processes and business needs.”\n• “Influences change in the product that benefits the user, gives the users a legitimate voice when discussing the product and the design of it, gathers a lot of insights that are useful for influencing design”\n• “He set up the whole of the antigen testing user research programme by himself in a very short space of time. It is an incredible achievement and it is mostly thanks to him that we are where we are right now.”\n• “Excellent research planning, research execution, research findings analysis and high-quality presentations of research findings”\n• “Significant improvements to research efficiency, highly detailed and thorough research outputs, deep thinking on ways of working.”\n• “Tom consistently remains focused on the users needs. He remains empathetic to their situation and is vital in bringing perspective to the discussion when the team requires it.”\n• “Hard working, has a large range of knowledge areas, very good at putting in to action ideas, very good at Qualtrics, very good at using Jira, very good at developing research plans, presents findings back well”\n• “He is very hardworking and dedicated to doing good work that will yield impactful results. He can both work on the ground and think strategically.”\n• “Commitment to UCD ways of working, persistence in solving problems and finding insights, ability to take very complex information and understand it quickly, ability to get the most from tools such as Qualtrics.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Image: Daniel Lerman\n\n\n\nPre-Discovery is a thing.\n\nI’ve been asked about: “What is a Pre-Discovery”?\n\nPre-Discovery is helpful for teams working on existing products and services where data can be gathered from internal resources. It should underpin the User Research Discovery themes and will make a big difference to the users approached and the questions asked during Discovery.\nTeams with an existing service will have questions such as:\n\nHow frequently is our service currently used?\nWhat is the demographic of the current user base?\nWhat have our users already told us about the current product?\nWhat are users pain points?\nWhat do users do before arriving in our service?\nWhat do users do after using our service?\nWhat are the main outcomes from using our service?\n\nTeams should list out the many dozens of questions they may need to answer through Discovery and then assess whether any internal data sources will answer this before kicking off new research.\n\nWhy more Pre-Discovery is helpful\nDiscovery is a awesome, challenging and rewarding too. Meeting users, getting immersed in their environment, understanding nuances in their needs. But Discovery is expensive and time consuming so we need to do try and answer questions effectively, in a targeted way.\n\n\n\nHere is my Pre-Discovery checklist:\n\nReview all previous research reports and surveys to identify relevant insight about a thing\nSpeak to service desk and review a sample of relevant service tickets\nReview analytics and performance data for the thing\nReview business case and benefits case for the thing, to see what benefits we expect users will see\nRun a quick session with Product, Sales or Implementation team to understand if there is knowledge or previous evidence about the thing\nHighlight in a service map where the thing sits in relation to other things\nEvaluate the benefits of fixing the thing\n\nTeams may say these activities should just happen in Discovery…\nWhile possibly true, most teams need to raise funding to pursue Discovery research and delivery projects and Pre-Discovery may be helpful to flesh out the business case and specify some problems to solve.\nGathering user research evidence for benefits early sets in motion good practice that should be continued through Discovery and Alpha. This also can help a team quickly surface all the key issues whether they need further understanding.\nGathering this data during Pre-Discovery won’t help you to confirm user needs, you will still need depth Discovery research. It also won’t help you identify the best solution, you will also need Alpha research and iterative design .\n\nMore benefits of Pre-Discovery\nPre-Discovery gives researchers some time to start thinking about finding the right users and starting recruitment so there is a seamless transition into Discovery when an Agile team may scale out and exploratory research and technical work really kicks off in earnest.\nPre-Discovery usually involves a limited number of roles too. A User Researcher, UX Designer, Service Designer and Business Analyst. It can take a few days to a few weeks to gather relevant insights.\n\n\nGetting buy in for your Pre-Discovery\nShare your Pre-Discovery evidence with key stakeholders and sponsors, to answer the question ‘What do we know?’, ‘What else do we need to know?’ and why should we buy into continue into Discovery phasee? Give them a flavour of the future: how will their world be better when they know more about how to solve a thing?\nKeeping momentum going\nIf more business cases were based on User Needs and Pre-Discovery evidence with further staged funding towards the end of Discovery/Alpha, there would surely be a lot less disappointment for users and stakeholders when product launches go awry. Less feature commitments will be promised that are later abandoned quietly during Discovery or Alpha, and importantly less irrelevant and implausible features will continue through to live service deployment.\nGetting started with UR projects isn’t always easy — Chicken or egg first? How do you complete a Pre-Discovery on the thing without funding or resources?\nBreaking the cycle is challenging especially when most teams might already at capacity with their existing commitments.\nInnovative organisations embed Pre-Discovery into their standard process for Strategy, Policy and Product. This support alignment at all levels to ensure outcomes are based on both user needs, and business needs.\n\n\n\nHow did your Pre-Discovery go?\nIf you found this post interesting or useful please comment below :) it would be great to hear your stories of Pre-Discovery!!"

    "text": "Reply\nReally interesting question. I’ve not seen any formal guidance on it –\nI guess my answer would be yes it varies between services. Big enough so you can get some useful insight and Small enough that it is low key and no one notices if you have to pull it?\nThe last thing you want for your ‘Private Beta’ service is to spend ages setting up a private beta panel/community only to not have enough users going through to gain any useful insight, this would be very expensive means of testing and validating a thing\nFor the new NHS Manage Your Referral Service (part of NHS e-Referral Service). We ran a very very small public beta. The old national service has around 1 million transactions per year, we used a tiny link on the homepage of the old service to redirect about 1% of users, we later made a more prominent link which redirected about 10%.\nWe had (for a few months) only a few dozen users per day — around 10% provided survey feedback (5–10 users per day) but the survey and analytics base sizes weren’t robust enough to say if it was statistically an improvement (e.g. Satisfaction/completion rate) over an old service it was due to replace — was this just by chance due to low sample and high margin of error.\nWhat you can do though with only a few users is analyse individual users and see why people drop off and the errors and make some informed changes based on analytics / database queries, that needs to be part of the private or public beta plan. Until you scale up you won’t know for sure if the private beta data is robust and the service is cooking on gas as many weird errors/alternative use cases that you won’t find in private beta testing are much less likely to occur with only a handful of users!\nI guess it comes back to your service, questions for the PO and UR to think about might be:\n\nwhat are the objectives are for private beta?\nwhat is the means for validating incremental improvements?\nis there is a drive/need to go for public beta?\nhow many changes are you planning to test? as you will need much larger numbers e.g. if using AB or multi variate testing,\nhow quickly can the team resolve issues/make changes?\nwhen should we scale up? how long will it take to gather * data to validate that it works?\n\nHope this helps!\nTom"

Whether this is through discovery interviews, co-creation & service design activities, or usability testing content and solutions; it is almost always impossible to make the right decisions without user research.\nAt a practical level, user researcher can’t answer every question, nor should they. There is a need to work with product leaders to createa a product strategy or roadmap to solve user problem. Even then, this strategy should not be taken as gospel, user research should support working through much of the finer details.\nThe correct (ironic) answer to these above quotes are:\nOk,the time when your really don’t need User Research is after the solution has been launched unsuccessfully and the project has to be closed down!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Great Logo: When Stakeholders Attack!\n\n\n\nWhy did I go?\nAs a User Researcher working in the NHS, it seems every project I have been involved in over 4 years has had ample stakeholders (internal and external) lobbying to influence the direction whether that is during planning, discovery research, design or delivery stages.\nEveryone seems to hold an opinion, on everything — all the time, opinion-based-judgement seems to disrupt the evidence-based process of identifying the right problem to solve and finding the best solution.\nThese experiences lead me to snap-up a ticket to the first Product People Midlands event. I was really impressed and excited to see an interesting event like this happening outside of London.\n\n\nWhat was this event about?\nAptly named ‘When stakeholders attack’ the meet-up set off with friendly words from the host Si Manby (ManbySi)and the event didn’t disappoint following that.\nThis was a great no-holds-barred think-out-loud debate about the major challenges facing many Product Managers and Product Teams across departments.\nThe presenters focused on re-occurring problem areas and each brought a key quotes to start their talk and discussion:\nKaz Hufton (@Kaz_H_666)\n \nThe talk focused on evidence of a fundamental misunderstanding of what “discovery” means,\n“every time I do a project I have to explain what a discovery is, and why we are doing it, to the same people. Like 68 times.”\n“It took me a year to realise what we were doing was based on a ‘Solution Definition’ and ‘Project Initiation’ documents that was written by one person and was based solely on their assumptions. The discovery stage was merely the first stage clearly marked out on their waterfall chart.”\nAlice Cudmore (@alice_cudmore)\n\nA great quote — probably the most over-used phrase I’ve heard.\n\nTo counter this question, there are suggestions around asking “why do you need to know”. Inevitably this would unpack a whole host of internal problems around fixation on timelines and milestone tracking, money, internal politics, resourcing problems, scope creep, and yes, more money.\n\n\n“Somehow there is no realisation when someone leaves you can’t just drop-ship in a new person with identical skills and experience; that the delivery of stuff is going to slow down.” Lauren Tombs (@TombsLauren)\n\n\nThe talk focused on product owners experiences of actually being empowered to decide things, but this constrained by excessive stakeholder requirements at the expense of user needs, usability, deliver-ability, and perhaps even common sense.\nSome great examples and it seems some projects have really tried every different stakeholder engagement approach to getting around this barrier,\nOne thought from from the floor… “If stakeholders want to block a project they will, can anything be done?”\n\n\nWhat else was discussed?\nThe session was 50%-masterclass, 50%-peer-therapy.\nThose attending added some quality case studies too from their vast years of product experience too.\nThe discussions touched on many broader problems within departments,\n\nBureaucratic internal approvals and support (e.g. procurement) processes,\nLack of trust and empowerment in teams,\nDocuments for the sake of documents, even when it is never read,\nLack of vision and intent from senior management,\nLessons not being learned time and again.\n\n\n\nSo who else attended?\nWell you may or may not know them, but if you work with them you have probably heard them. They are often noisey, nosey, confrontational perhaps, contrarians yes, asking lots of awkward questions yes, blunt yes, rude — perhaps? Still can’t find them.. Look for a person not wearing a blue or grey suit. Possibly a T-shirt.\n\nChallengers to say the least. Yes, these are the Product People — an emerging force of thinkers, doers, realists, persuaders who have are massively passionate about what they do and have a full grasp of their users, the business and technology.\n\nThose Product Managers, Product Leads, Senior Product Owners are seemingly doing a lot of hard work to put whimsically-flimsey ideas through their paces and deliver stuff of actual end-user value and quality for organisations.\nOne experienced manager was asked how they should decide who internally would a suitable for that role,\n“Look at your department and pick the people who are asking the most awkward questions.”\nAnother speaker noted “Problems were occurring on several projects as the previous Product Manager was saying yes to everyone’s requests without thinking.”\n“If you’re not saying No and upsetting someone most weeks you’re probably not doing it right.”\nProduct managers seem to be routinely confused with project managers, delivery managers, and service owner roles. Bizarrely, as pointed out, these Product Managers are set objectives and assessed on delivering value, however this often flies in direct conflict with colleagues whose objectives are set to deliver specific features.\nSome debate occurred around a perception that the role of GDS as a “referee of quality” and “stick to wave” it’s is not functioning as well as it previously as a central function, with formal assessments. People just ignore the User needs bit and skip into design, the Product managers are being asked whats the minimum they could do to pass the assessment.\nAlso, questions surrounded the role “Service Manager” while that started with a good intention, it could have become diluted and confused to the point it is almost meaningless.\n\n\nWhat was the event like?\nWell the story unfolded fast, but not like the David and Goliath where a simple slingshot brings a giant to it’s knee.\nNo this was something else, much akin to the Resistance vs. the First Order in the Star Wars Last Jedi. The unyielding, unmerciful, crushing, gripping nature of the order on the product community working across departments was pretty clear.\n\nHowever, from the resistance side it wasn’t all poke-fun at Mr Blobby and the order, as that’s easily done. The discussions were tempered with empathy with the group considering the other side of the coin too… interesting questions were raised like:\n“What might be motivating stakeholders and organisations to put in place these constraints?”,\n“Why are they risk averse?”, “Why do they oppose change?”,\n“Can transformation really be complete if they (..read the staff..) oppose all change?”,\n“Why would people who benefit from hierarchy for 20 years or more want to empower their teams?”.\n\n\nMy thoughts following the event\nThe strange thing to me, in this story about products an delivery life-cycles, ironically and sadly the ‘product community’ are cast as the pantomime villains.\nThe collective insight, expertise and experience at the meet was shocking… shocking in the sense that such a group who clearly have huge talent and can add so much value to organisations have had to suffer so many battle scars and have so many ridiculous tales to tell. Why do organisations not learn from past mistakes?\nWhat with it being 2019, I’m not sure whether it was reassuring or concerning to learn these problems exist and seem consistent across departments.\nThe answers during the discussion were considered, and the situation seems vastly complex, so it’s not surprising that any transformation across departments is hard to start and even harder to make stick.\nOne point felt clear. Between the old and new ways of doing things, it seems like stalemate. On both sides now and this results in ignoring or ridiculing, rather than trying to find any solution.\nLack of user-centered and product-focus, probably means that many times things are being built based on assumptions; opportunities are likely to be missed too and delivery is not always going to succeed.\nMy question to readers would be ‘Should Product Management and following user-centered design still be considered a movement, or is that seen as best practice, and — in essence — the new norm?’\n\n\nTL;DR\nThe Product People community is growing and maturing. Be aware, boo is coming to a goose near you.\nThis was a great event in the Midlands, even when the group skimmed the stone across the top of the lake, rather than just focusing on the topic ‘When Stakeholders Attack’ there was really interesting, thoughtful discussion and banter.\nWould I go to the next Product People midlands event? 5 stars yes for sure. There are so many important topics to explore that I only hope there are more events like this (outside London).\nWell that’s my take out anyway :)"

    "text": "I’ve seen teams design lovely journeys and content but not understanding what is the core thing they do that adds value for their users.\nIn UX the focus is often to understand users and their needs, obviously that is important but, this is different from having a strong value proposition.\nSolutions are typically created to meet a need identified in Discovery, usability testing an Alpha will tell us if it is usable. Somewhere in the middle of Discovery and Alpha often things get lost and stuff gets released without initially exploring if the team are creating a strong value proposition.\nCan this new thing be described succinctly in a way that is appealing and effectively communicates why people should use the new product / service / feature. If it can’t be explained, it won’t get used (or sold).\nTo help unpick this issue, some useful research questions spring to mind.\nDIFFERENTIATION\n\nWhy would you use this thing over the 10+ other things that perform similar functions?\n\nMASTERY\n\nWhat is the 1 best thing about this product?\nWhat does it do that you can’t do with anything else?\n\nFIRST IMPRESSION\n\nWhat 3 words come to mind after initially seeing the service or brand?\nWho do you think would create a thing like this? (i.e. white-label testing)\n\nEXPERIENCE DELIGHT\n\nHow did you feel while going through the journey?\n\nRECALL & VIRAL EFFECTS\n\nHow would you describe the thing to a friend?\nWhat would you type in search to find this thing?\n\nCONVERSION & RETENTION\n\nWould you swap your current one for this one?\nWould you come back to the service tomorrow? Why?\n\nRESOURCEFULNESS & PRODUCTIVITY\n\nWhat would you do with the money/time you saved by using this product?\n\nFrom working previously with start-ups, entrepreneurs and blue chip clients for several years to evaluate markets, test concepts, optimise and promote their services I realised the products & teams that survived, grew, or got funding typically had similar traits:\n\na strong value proposition, product market fit, a sense of purpose, and a compelling story.\n\nIn commercial spaces this type of information is typically communicated through landing pages. We know these are robustly built using keyword discovery and conversion testing.\nIn the public sector transaction space most service landing pages are instructional with a big “Start now” button. Value proposition and descriptive information is rarely considered appropriate.\nIn a pure transactional space where there is no alternative, e.g. license renewal, people just want to find a task and get it done then that’s fine\nIn sectors such as the NHS where many platforms and services (central, regional, local, etc) are vying for the same users, then value proposition becomes really important.\nWhy would a hospital use this supplier over the other supplier? Is it worth using the centralised systems that are good but not perfect vs. spending millions on custom builds? Why would a patient use a health app when there are 10,000 other health apps?\nIn the start-up world if there is an unclear need or weak value proposition, this usually equates to none-startup, or launch followed by graduate-decline, or outright failure.\nIn my opinion, gentrification of digital services is a risky double-edged-sword. While making things consistent can reduce time to build a thing and increase the success rates for tasks, it could slow down product adoption.\nI’m surprised when it comes to service landing pages that the commercially-savvy Product Managers and the communications leads aren’t pushing for value-focused messaging and targeted advertising (over generic national campaigns) as these are shown to improve the experience, improve adoption rates, aid retention and likelihood to recommend.\nThere are many great things happening in the public sector digital space, but we’re still playing catch-up in terms of understanding how best to communicate the value and drive adoption for various services and platforms we create."

It has only been five weeks so we’ve got time… our other patients need to go first.”\nPharmacy — “We put you on a highest dose of the recomended prescription. We could try a different mix but those meds are sub-optimal.”\nGP — “I’ve referred you to the right speciality — there are no other local choices.”\nCommissioner — “We need to cut the costs in the area so we block commissioned. We don’t want to have local restrictions but we must optimise local resourcing within our budget. You can go to another service but we tell GPs to use this service first.”\nPrivate providers — “We have some capacity… but if you apply for funding it’s unlikely to get approved. Or you could pay.”\nNHS 111 — “We’ve assessed you but you need to go back to your GP and pharmacy as it’s a long term condition — you’re already in their system. If your symptoms suggest it’s an emergency we would arrange an ambulance.”\nSystem supplier — “Patients can always raise a complaint… but we provide IT and that is working fine. We don’t provide direct healthcare. If a patient thinks there is a bug they contact the service desk. If we confirm a bug we fix it under the Service Level Agreement.”\nOnline survey — “This is an automated monitoring service we don’t respond to individual comments.”\nResearch team — “These patient comments are upsetting, yes. The patient is angry too. Yet their situation is the same as thousands of other patients waiting for appointments. We see comments like this all the time and if their comments suggest a specific risk of harm we send it to a clinician.”\nThe time that is needed say “I’m sorry, I can’t help, please follow this process” is small to each actor. Allthe actors get paid for their part in the agreed process, and they also get a little drop of happiness by “nudging the patient along in the right direction”.\nThe consequences of this process for the patient is a complete timesink navigating various silos, it can make patients lose trust in the NHS.\nIf a patient condition starts to deteriorate, how will the patient know who to reach out to? It may feel as though no one is managing their care and there is a real risk they fall through gaps in provision.\nIf a patient deteriorates and they need an ambulance or they end up at Accident & Emergency… the fact they have a referral and have booked an appointment with a specialist doesn’t matter."

    "text": "This post is about how I influenced the service and interaction design team on a major programme to adopt new processes\n\nWhat is a prototype for?\nSeveral weeks after working on the Testing programme I noticed that all the designers from consultancies were only trained to use Sketch.\nTheir agency design approach followed one process:\n\ndraw up some ideas quickly, get them signed off quickly, and code and deploy the solution!\n\nWhile it seemed efficient as a process could get, things became problematic when the team needed to start testing these designs every week. This was an important step to put a few brakes in place to check solutions worked for users, before their national release to the public.\nWe conducted a few rounds of usability testing using these Sketch prototypes; it works o.k. for some projects as you can make the prototype clickable, however\nSketch prototypes are really not ideal for regular usability testing because:\n• you can’t see what a design looks like on different devices (e.g. a mobile view),\n• users cannot interact with form elements,\n• form errors / validation don’t work,\n• users are exposed to button prompts every time they click the incorrect button, leading them to the answer each time, and\n• users may see the comments from designers!\nThese factors make for a very sketchy usability testing session! The participant is unable to experience the service as they would if they were at home on their own. It gives the research and design team mcch less confidence in the research findings.\nFor live-like usability testing I would much prefer to give the participant a link to the prototype that will work on any device they are using, at any resolution, with any additional software tools they have installed.\nI made the case to the consultancy designers that they needed to create these prototypes in html, using the Gov.uk prototype kit; however as they had not done this before as most hadn’t worked as interaction designers on government projects before.\n\n“If you know what good looks like – don’t stand still in a crisis – move things forward!”\n\nHonestly, after working with NHS designers for four years I was really frustrated at the unavailability of an html prototype.\nI decided to take things into my own hands and two days out of my role as a researcher to build the first end-to-end journey using the Gov.uk prototype kit.\nWe tested using this version for two weeks, while NHS Digital quickly redeployed other interaction designers from national programmes to continue the design work and train consultancy staff in best practices for using the prototype kit.\nIn the end, the outcome was positive and the researchers have had good quality prototypes to work going forward; although at the time it was slightly awkward to need to step over an imaginary UR/UX/UI “role boundary” to help speed up an inevitable change.\nObviously this caused some challenges and debates within the team at the time, but from that point on many benefits of being able to design with version controls, test on any device, conduct unmoderated testing. These benefits hopefully far outweighed any initial discomfort within the team.\nMap of the Testing world\nAnother new concept I introduced within the team fairly early on was creating an end-to-end journey map. From the initial gov.uk prototype I created, I took screenshots of every page and linked these up as a flow in Miro (Yes, it took a while!)\nThe primary reason at the time was to help capture notes from multiple user research sessions in the same place, so that we could identify which screens were most problematic by ‘virtually affinity sorting’ the findings.\nThis approach was then adopted by the service designers and interaction designers, who continued to maintain up to date maps of the current, the past and the future design iterations week on week.\nThe resource has been great for user researchers, designers, product, clinical and governance colleagues, but more generally anyone who recently joins the team they can instantly view what the end-to-end service looks like in one place.\n\n\n\nThe e2e journey map I started was kept up-to-date by the UX team for 2 years!\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you had to take on my than one role? or push for change? let us know in the chat below :)"

    "text": "This post is about delivering user research insights within a fast-moving, continually changing, service environment\n\nStakeholders on any critical programme are typically very busy, some key decision makers will only have time to attend a ‘kick off’ meeting and ‘debrief meeting/Show and Tell’.\nOver this summer, our team conducted hundreds of user interviews, across dozens of rounds of research, with people who had requested a coronavirus test.\nThe research team were very proud to be working on such an important project and delivering great insights at pace, however as the weeks past by, and more evidence was gather about the challenges that users were experiencing, I realised we had a problem.\nIn our internal Retro the team discussed why the discovery and usability testing reports were starting to pile but we were unsure why key recommendations were not being actioned. I decided to lead to an internal discovery, to understand where our data was (or wasn’t) going, and how we could improve the user research process to make the findings more impactful.\n\n\n\nFindings from 20 internal interviews with colleagues\n\n\nI arranged 20-minute telephone interviews with internal colleagues and stakeholders: researchers, content managers, clinical leads, product managers, service designers, interaction designers, policy people, information analysts, accessibility leads, programme managers, operations and assurance leads.\nThe goal was to understand their own needs for insight and to unpick the challenges the reserach team were facing; it was also an important opportunity to build trust with colleagues by inviting them to be a participant in our research process.\nHere is our internal research exploration discussion guide:\n\nWhat is your role…? and what do you do?\n\n\nWhat “decisions” are you involved with?\n\n\nDo you produce data or consume data? or both?\n\n\nWhat insights and data do you have access to?\n\n\nWhere does the data come from? i.e. Who provides it?\n\n\nWhat is working well?\n\n\nHow Relevant, Robust, Timely is the data?\n\n\nWhich bits of data are hardest to access/ find?\n\n\nWhat happens with the data you get?\n\n\nHow does data inform decision making?\n\n\nHow is feedback prioritised? (if at all)\n\n\nAre improvements being made following feedback?\n\n\nOverall, how easy or difficult is it to find good feedback / insights / data?\n\n\nWhat would you most like to see improved?\n\nAs with all our discoveries, the anonymised findings had been documented in Miro and further analysis/affinity sorting was conducted to identify the core problems.\nSome of the findings from the continuous improvement discovery included:\n• Product and stakeholders already access loads of data and insight, many of these sources the research were not aware of,\n• Colleagues have limited time to spend listening to the feedback, finding time to observe primary research is almost impossible,\n• Some times our insight hasn’t been seen as robust enough by stakeholders,\n• It was unclear who should take responsibility for the findings and actioning improvements!\nThis lead to myself and the team implementing a number of improvements over the following weeks:\n• Introduce regular, but short, Show and Tells; ideally 15~ minutes presenting and 10-15 minute questions;\n• Arrange follow-up workshops to key agree actions and move these forward,\n• I started creating a repository of findings, so colleagues could see at a glance what is up with the service,\n• Present a 5-minute research update each week at the ‘All staff Stand Up’, to increase awareness of the work,\n• Look to triangulate data (e.g. with analytics) and to start comparing findings over multiple rounds of research,\n• Where there is time, include short video clips in the Show and Tells, to increase the time colleagues have hearing from users.\nWhose research is it anyway?\nI personally learned to appreciate that were many more decisions were being made within the policy, service and product space than the research team were told about – other teams were using other data insight sources much more than we were aware of! Understanding the process helped us to improve how we shared insights too.\nAnother discovery was that as researchers we should not feel need to continually chase-up resolutions to every problem and recommendation presented at the Show and Tell. Many of the team’s research recommendations were valid and important to users, however unless these were complete Show-Stoppers to a committed delivery/policy the recommendations would simply have to wait till things calmed down a bit.\nPlaying a long game: as researchers we provide insights that can lead to a few quick wins, but gathering and presenting robust evidence will inevitably help shape service and product managers thinking, programmes slowly move to being more user-centred over time.\nUnderstanding these internal decision making processes and role boundaries really helped reduce both the burden and stress for reserachers and to improve our focus in future research studies!\n\nTL;DR\nWhen everyone is “very busy” conducting research for a product or service team, it’s too easy to forget the importance of considering how findings will be documented and shared.\nTaking time to reflect on the needs of colleagues and stakeholders who will be consuming the data, and how recommendations get actioned, is very important part of continuous improvement\nTom, NHS Digital – Test and Trace\n\n\n\n\nHow was your experience of testing? do share in the comments below :)"

    "text": "This post highlights a few workarounds that can deliver good results for projects doing “adhoc” unmoderated testing on your html prototypes\n\nThe journey had so many screens to test, that even with 90-minute interviews we struggled to get robust consistent feedback over multiple rounds of testing This post is about how I created an unmoderated usability testing platform at the Test and Trace service.\nDesigners and product people may just need data to make a few quick decisions. Does this page work better? Does the form work? How can it be optimised? Do people follow on-page instructions? Critically these designs, and decisions, should be validated with users before putting them live.\nHowever when you are working at pace, to some stakeholders and researchers the moderated testing approach can feel like a luxury, even a barrier to delivery. Also moderated testing approaches, and manual analysis of stickies, tends to fall over as soon as any need to split usability findings by different user groups.\nIn one recent Test and Trace project, the end-to-end journey had over 100 pages. We already tested it for 90-minutes over multiple rounds with 4-6 users.\nI appreciate all the evidence and arguments around ‘5 users is enough’ to identify the most critical issues (and all the counter arguments against that too). However, in our experience on this project 5-users (multiple rounds) was still not enough to gather consistent insights as the journey was very long/complex journey that jumps between service channels. We also had some inconsistencies from adjusting focus each Sprint to include new service features/content that needed testing, and differences in opinion among the diverse demographics of users who participated too.\n\n\n\nImage: Mohamed\n\n\n\nWorkaround Methods to Scale-Up\nI knew we needed to scale-up the research approach, so that we could rapidly and robustly test any element of the service and provide same day insights. Acquring a commercial off the shelf (COTS) unmoderated tool can cost tens/hundreds of thousands, we would need to scope the requirement, find the budget, seek internal approvals, go to market; basically it would take multiple months to procure a tool (if it could be done at all). An alternative solution was required urgently as the finding were needed immediately.\nUsing GitHub and VSCode I deployed a few changes to the same GOV.uk html prototype kit that our interaction designers were using. I designed a research scenario similar to the one we typically use for a moderated interview, adding this as a new “Start page” within the prototype. Users were invited to provide ‘dummy information’ into the forms.\nI then embedded GTM (Google Tag Manager) and from here deployed a number of other conversion optimisation tools such as Google Analytics, Google Optimize (for AB Testing), Inspectlet and HotJar (for on-page feedback, session recording, heatmaps), and Qualtrics (for an exit survey).\nThe main technical challenge beyond installing these tools, was to deploy Cookies and Triggers correctly within GTM to ensure only users who arrived as part of a specific research usability testing activity, who had consented to be tracked, we observed through the journey.*\nThis was because the prototype was already being shared widely with stakeholders, and so it was important to keep research data separate for analysis purposes.\n\n\nTesting at scale\n[Insert anonymised video clip of user session here]\nBy following an unmoderated testing approach, through using our own user panels we were able to test with approximately 1 hundred users each round.\nThis would produce 8 to 10 hours of session replays, which could be reviewed at 2x or 4x speed. As no analytics was available in the live service, we gathered baseline data such as:\n\nnumber of pages visited per user,\nconversion funnels and drop outs,\nkeyboard entry data for forms,\nheatmaps / click analysis,\ntime on task for the journey,\nhow many participants perform a ‘U turn’,\nsatisfaction metrics,\nease-of-use metrics,\ncontextual feedback about all pages in the journey.\n\nOverall this new data helped to validate and prioritise many of the findings we had seen in the moderated testing.\nConclusively, the digital journey is has been demonstrated to be far too long relative to the task of getting a coronavirus test. The consequence is that many users only skim-read the guidance, then abandon later due to usability other issues.\nBeing asked ‘just one more question’ with ‘no end in sight’ and ‘no guarantee of a test’, is not supportive for users with symptoms of a potentially dangerous virus where anxiety and stress is already very high. The product people and stakeholders fed back they had more confidence in our teams’ work now they could see the whole journey had been tested with a whole lot more users.\n\n\nTL;DR\nThe most impactful UX teams are taking a blended approach to different usability methods - combining qualitative, quantitative, analytics and also survey data.\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like more help with unmoderated testing, let me know below"

    "text": "This post is about a recent project I conducted with the LGBTQI+ community around ‘Asking about Gender’\n\n\nBefore reading ahead, please be aware some people may find some of this content upsetting.\nTo skip this post please click here to return to the homepage\n\nWhen I was asked to look into the Testing needs of transgender users, and to understand how they would feel about some new designs, I was initially very apprehensive.\nTransgender participants are not a user group that I have specifically recruited or interviewed before. I was concerned if the usual research approaches would be suitable. What if I said the “wrong thing” and upset a participant - it might make a contentious situation even worse.\nThen I realised, as a User Researcher, some times ignorance is bliss. Like a passport to speak to anyone - but we still need to do that with respect.\nThe project was a great opportunity lead from the front - learn more about an seldom-heard and diverse user group, and to share learnings with a wide team. With that in mind I looked ahead positively, acknowledging a risk that we may say the wrong thing or ask the wrong question, but doing the research was key to understanding and progressing the service to a better place.\n\nResearch context and planning\nAlways best to follow good practices, but here are some additional considerations that needed to be made to ensure the study reached it’s goal:\n\nMore secondary research was conducted. For example, reviewing previous rounds and exploring voices on social media); we anticipated from this that the service feedback would likely be fairly bad,\nIt was also known that the research could be emotionally challenging for the participants and moderator; I briefed note takers around the sensitivity of the subject,\nWe anticipated drop outs; users were likely to be worried before talking with an organisation they felt had not treated them well. A personalised reminder email or quick call ahead of the sessions, would be an ideal approach. Fortunately, I overbooked as several participants dropped out last minute.\nAs these were remote interviews, we ensured the moderator’s camera was on all the time; this was so that the participant could see who they are talking with, and that we were actively listening to personal and challenging feedback,\nConsent to record - I asked for written and verbal consent. With the option for participants to have their video deleted afterwards. Ideally we would also offer to share a copy of the video with the participant too - they may need to view the journey with their family/friends/support group,\nStart slowly - I knew it would be important to establish trust early in the interview and then cover more difficult topics towards the end of the interview,\nI provided even more opt-outs for participants than usual\n“if there is anything you would prefer not to talk about please let us know.”\n“if we ask a question you are uncomfortable with we are happy to skip that.”\n“If you feel you need to take a break - absolutely that is fine.”\n“Any questions? just ask”\n“Are you ok to go on..?”\nRespecting privacy is always important I asked for permission before asking anything particularly sensitive follow-up questions (e.g. “do you mind if we ask about your gender?”)\nEmpathise with their challenges, but don’t lead responses e.g. “hm… I guess.. in that difficult situation.. I imagine… your feelings might have been…… [pause… wait… listen]” This was probably the biggest challenge with doing this type of research remotely, you need to keep talking and reassuring participant that you are still there and also visibly and actively listening.\nAnonymise evidence - To protect users’ identity, participant numbers were randomised in the report, all faces were blurred in sharing the findings. We deleted the original recordings as quickly as feasible\n\n[To add later - Image of Testing screen / Quotes from research]\n\nImmediately after the research - 21/11\nBeing briefly in someone else’s shoes is a mysterious thing. Remote researchers may rarely come across precious moments like this. It took several weeks, for the impact of this research to fully sink in. For several days immediately after conducting these interviews, I felt fully unproductive and distracted whenever asked to join other meetings and having to context switch.\nI was keen to complete the research and analysis, knowing if it takes to long, the strong connection between participant and moderator fades away. What I heard was so impactful to me, I didn’t want to let this message just pass by, or to lose focus on the goal of sharing valuable insight about the vulnerable group (who by this time we knew they felt they were badly discriminated against - i.e. denied access to Tests).\nTheir story needed to be shared, loud and clearly.\nRealising the possible significance of this work, it quickly turned into fears.\nThe pressure of delivering the insight, truthfully, in a way that respects users’ privacy and gender identity, but brings the full raw emotional view from the participants to share their individual needs.\nI spent several days (and late nights) immersed among data for the important analysis; watching the clips over-and-over to fully understand the issues, how best the message could be shared broadly.\nIn the end, I was unable to find a way to describe the findings that would do justice to the emotion of what had been said. I then decided to anonymise all the key video clips for the team and played these back at an extended Show and Tell.\nOver 80 colleagues attended and the output was received with great appreciation from the Reserach, Design, EDI Team (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion) team and LGBT community.\nWhat people were unaware I was in bed feeling sick and deeply upset about the study findings; how would I feel to continue working on a service that has caused this distress for thousands of people during a national health crisis? Staying on the pitch to make sure the research had an impact, rather than walking away with anguish, was my way of keeping the momentum going towards a change and to hopefully make the service just a bit better.\nA few weeks later - 6/12\n\n\n\nTaking time to reflect. Image: Jayden Yoon ZK\n\n\nIt is still a difficult project for me to think about. Like many other emotinally-charged projects i’ve worked on in the past decade, I don’t think I’ll be able to forget this one either. Knowing the signs of emotional burden, third-party (vicarious) trauma, and knowing when and how to seek support from colleagues or professionals makes it feel safer to do these studies.\nFor researchers, knowing that services accidentally (or deliberately) discriminate against user groups is important. It still happens today - even in 2020. Inclusion and accessibility are both principles and legal commitments, but in reality most public services aren’t fully equitable or inclusive.\nIt can’t be underestimated how upsetting it is for the people to go through experiences like that, where a service with just few words written on a page, can makes a person feel so insignificant to make them feel in their own words “like they don’t even exist”.\nSpeaking to vulnerable user groups and carrying these heavy burdens is perhaps why many research and design teams stick to researching the ‘middle of the road’. Public sector teams need to learn much more vulnerable user groups, key insight is often found at the edges.\nThere is a real risk, that without more diverse participation in research studies, that teams are acidentally designing for “middle class, digitally savvy, well-educated, vehicle owners, mostly white, with lots of spare time.” However, the audience who really need testing is skewed towards under-representative communities who are being hardest hit by the virus.\nI appreciate the main challenge “Asking about Gender with trans communities” hasn’t actually been fixed (as yet - Dec 2020), but my research has helped stimulate conversations and collaborations towards finding a solution to the long-standing-root-cause problems (i.e. that GP record’s are not inclusive, it’s difficult match users to a GP record).\nIn the short term these findings have improved understanding of a seldom-heard community, and raised the quality bar in the Testing and Vaccination services to ensure we they are ‘more inclusive’ with design and hopefully, with time, the service can be ‘fully inclusive’.\n\n\nTL;DR\nResearching sensitive topics with hard to reach users is critical for understanding what happens ‘around the edges’ of a service.\nIt is a heavy burden for all involved, so aim to do it just once and deliver the research with a profound impact.\nAs UCD practictioners we need to hear the raw words and emotion to understand complex user needs; fixing these issues is difficult but not only does it make the service more inclusive, but it builds trust and respect across all user groups.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have been on a similar challenging project, do share your thoughts below"

    "text": "Some backstory…\nAfter graduating with an International Business degree from a great uni I had high ambitions. However it was 2009 and the global financial crisis had just hit everything, most grad schemes had closed for applications.\nThere was also a general election 2010 and the government department where I completed my industrial work placement was closed down as part of the spending review – all the people I worked with were made redundant or let go. Many good people were looking for work it was a tough time to be a graduate.\nAnyway, after months being unemployed doing the job-centre-thing and contacting many employers every single day, eventually I got lucky landing my first job out of uni as a temp research worker at the niche kids research and games design agency Dubit.\nOver 4 years, I learnt the ropes took on more challenging projects and was very fortunate to work with big media brands such as Channel 4, Sky, EDF Energy and Random House publishing (and many others just to name a few).\nWhat was most fortunate about this job, was not the clients, but the research team who at the time (around 2010) were really top of the user-insight game. They strongly believed that using mixed-methods, co-creation/user-centred design and working in close collaborations with their clients was the best way to deliver successful products and services to market. Although it was only a small team, it was a very exciting the time.\n\n\nHow do we discover?\nOne particular project I gladly remember was conducting twenty in-home immersive interviews to study children’s mobile gaming habits, lifestyles and entertainment interests for a media company.\nThe client was exploring a “new app” in the fast-growing kids games segment at the time. Of course the client didn’t want to be named in case any competition found out about the research/app. From the start all the app designs and research stimulus contained a funky project codename. Their app wasn’t production ready at all, only a proof of concept (very basic with some embedded free games like Tetris / minesweeper).\nI travelled all over the country to moderate these two-hour sessions in family homes – after some introductions with parents and talking through the project brief, we’d do a few warm-up activities before letting their kids loose on the ‘new app’. After 20-minutes only this new app had spoken for itself – kids had got bored quickly and wanted to return to their own iPads.\nI’d then let the session flow into discovery and explore the plethora of 2D/3D immersive freemium games that were available at the time. Unsurprisingly most parents were not bothered by content guidelines so six years old kids could easily be playing games aged 10+. As long as the kids weren’t buying things in the App store and their parents could take a break, everyone was happy.\nWhile doing these in-home discovery/testing sessions, it was important to be ready with lots of backup activities for when the “app testing” ended.\nE.g. a “Day in the life of challenge”… or an Argos catalogue moodboard. Can you group together all the toys and games they have into new/used, or talk about which characters you like/dislike, or what things do you want for Christmas? what games are kids at school playing? etc… with the consent from parents we may view kids online history or YouTube playlists, to see what they are routinely searching for (and so what brands they see most often).\nWhen we played back the “app testing” research to the client team it was clear this app would have performed pretty badly in it’s current form. This led to more intrigue around what we had learnt during the discovery, our evidence prompted a rethink for the client’s product design.\nFurther co-creation work with real end users was conducted at the in-house games development studio; eventually some new ideas became a real thing that required proper usability testing… and so circling back around insight from this throw-away-app gave rise to a much more successful product that is still available today (almost 10 years later)!\n\n\nWhat about discovery in the health sector?\nI’ve worked as a User Researcher in the healthcare sector for six years now. Many teams often talk about their discovery and profound understanding user needs, indeed it is a requirement for GDS and NHS.uk Service Standards.\nFrom the many hundreds of research projects and thousands of interviews that I have seen, or been part of, real discovery research rarely happens, in my view.\nHere are some issues that are routinely observed:\n1. It’s usually not for the want of trying by User Researchers, but there broadly is no culture of discovery. Programme management don’t acknowledge a need to understand users context, lifestyle, values, motivations, needs. Usually programme management are mandating digital teams deliver a thing committed by ‘VIP stakeholder / HIPPO’\n2. Also very few teams are working on research and solving “real problems” around a root cause. All the time is spent understanding and unpicking the consequences of previous projects, so it is almost impossible to get a new and proper greenfield discovery off the ground\n3. Everyone we work with is a patient, so everyone becomes “an expert user advocate”; there is an assumption that teams know users but often they are over confident and think that no discovery is required\n4. The same teams have usually been in place many years; collectively they assume they have user knowledge, a shared expertise, that means discovery is also not required\n5. When discovery happens, it is timeboxed to a few short weeks. Discovery at worst it is a 15-minute warm-up activity before showing some screenshots. This happens a lot\n6. Discovery scope is often limited to digital interactions only. Often discoveries are narrowed to a product channel/theme that is a focus of a new feature (e.g. can we discover what communication channel people want to receive alert messages on?)\n7. If real discovery is happening, which I don’t believe it is, sharing of this information more widely is not happening\n8. Discovery teams often get closed down if they don’t also come up with ‘a solution’\n\n\nMaking health discovery a bit better\nTo change the outcomes, we need to change the process and inputs.\nReally good discovery should be ongoing ethnography, both tactical (e.g. thematic) and more strategic (e.g. longitudinal or lifestyle)\nWe need to be more honest about this, so when we are asked ‘who are our users’ and ‘what are their needs’.\nIf a proper discovery has not been completed in the last 18 months, the best answers too give are:\n\nA “We don’t yet know as we’ve not done much discovery work recently”\n\n\nA* “We have documents needs and/or personas, but these are based only historical discovery evidence, subject matter expertise, and/or assumptions that may be wrong”\n\nIdeally teams would complete discovery, and continue to learning about users needs throughout service and product lifecycle.\nWhile discussing a new urgent requirement, and whether discovery is needed it can be a difficult conversation. But it’s important to persist and champion this need to give the project and service users the best opportunity for a successful outcome.\nHave you ever heard a Product Owner or Delivery manager say any of these phrases? If so then your user researcher/s have certainly done a great job in embedding a culture of research and discovery within the team.\nAAA**\n\n“We are not our users”\n\n “We are aware of our internal unconscious bias, cultural norms, that make us different to our users”\n\n “We listen to users, but don’t judge users”\n\n “We have empathy, not sympathy”\n\n “We care about our users and we want them to have a great experience”\n\n “We want our users to achieve their goal efficiently”\n\n “We’ve actually meet end users, a good cross-section”\n\n “We spoke to the people who have abandoned/rejected using our service”\n\n “We spent a decent amount of time in their environment”\n\n “We observed them without interfering with their day”\n\n “We understand their context, in a way that is broader than our service model”\n\n “We enjoy talking about their pain points and underlying needs”\n\n “We understand that their needs change from time-to-time”\n\n “We learn about our users behaviour through qualitative and quantitative data”\n\n “We regularly co-design with our end users”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nWorking in a digital multidisciplinary team it is almost impossible to get a “real discovery” off the ground. It’s not just a commitment and funding issue, but a lack of understanding.\nWe need more programme directors who understand what a real discovery looks like and can smells fake discoveries a mile off.\nProduct teams need to get closer to users, immerse themselves, among insights about the lifestyles of end users to identify real user needs and root cause problems.\n\n\n\n\nHow is your discovery going? share your challenges below"

As I really enjoy all the frontline research and hearing users talk about the thing, I really hope to continue observing regular research sessions and attend the (many) research playbacks too!\nImportantly I need colleagues to remind me “not to worry about the details” as we now have an expanded team who manage and deliver the research activities. The processes we have work well and the team are brilliant, always deliver great insight, always improving things too.\nIf you are interested in learning more about what Senior User Researchers do I’m always happy to share more insight about this challenging and rewarding role.

    "text": "User journey for the sprint\n\n\nThe last round of research I delivered was in January, since then our amazing team of User Researchers have been ploughing ahead delivering great projects and new insights every week. We’re on Sprint 22 (Round 165) currently!\nHaving just enough researchers enabled me to spend more time scoping requests, planning ahead and working on some continuous improvement themes that support our researchers to improve overall quality and work more effectively.\nI like to regularly remind our team that I’m super keen to attend at least one research session each week! As a kinaesthetic learner I love hearing users’ stories first hand - it lasts much longer than hearing findings being played back at another Show and Tell (yes there are many UR playbacks each week!!)\nThis week was a really interesting week, and maybe I did speak to soon about getting immersed in some research… Due to resource changes in our team and several ‘urgent requests / policy updates / user journey changes’ I needed to jump straight back into a high-priority discovery project and deliver some actual research.\nIt was a crazy week-or-so but yesterday, the 2-week discovery concluded and the project team have enough user insight to feedback to their delivery board and (hopefully) to make the right decisions ahead of going into Alpha.\n\nSo what did we do ?\n\n\n\nImage: Calendar showing busy week with 12 user interviews and loads of stakeholder meetings in between!\n\n\nWednesday (14th) - Thursday (15th)\n\nDiscovery project kick off - understanding the business problem and objective. Defining what we need to learn about our users and their needs.\nCreating service design concepts (to do the right thing) - working really closely with service design / content / policy / clinical and operations\nArrange recruitment for 12 participants with a variety of test experience and from different demographic groups.\nUsually we might only gather feedback from 5-6 users however as there were four contrasting concepts we thought we would need 8-10 users to get a robust overall preference\n\nFriday (16th) - Monday (19th)\n\nSketch user flows, heuristic review to question any assumptions\nPrepare content to support testing, check with clinical / policy / legal / ops. ** Early content testing is helpful for understanding awareness, perceived value and sentiment about concepts. It can also identify motivators/detractors that may can make the comms/onboarding for a new concept succeed or fail.\nPrepared research scripts, reviewed these with the team and stakeholders to understand if the objectives and questions would meet everyone’s needs\nMoved 5 research sessions booked for Monday back to later in week - the content wasn’t ready just yet.\n\nTuesday (20th)\n\nInterview users / test concepts (5 users) 1 hour session each with short break. ** Usually at least 1-2 would drop out so we overbook but un/fortunately everyone turned up - it was a REALLY long day!!\nInterim analysis required for digital Standup next day\n\nWednesday (21st)\n\nAM - regular team meetings; these are really important to keep in touch and plan ahead even when the research is still going on at full pace. It gives you a break to reflect on things with colleagues\nPM - continue interviews! (3 more users)\nStakeholder engagement at various project meetings\n\nThursday (22nd)\n\nAM/PM - interview users / test concepts. 2 more users / 1 cancellation).\nIt turned out that by user 8 we already had a clear favourite and second favourite concepts, however these final 2 users helped validate that insight with another demographic segment\nLunch - went for a short walk and the first chance to reflect on the findings\nStakeholder engagement at various project meetings\n\nFriday (23rd)\n\nAM - Finalise analysis on Miro\nAM - Finalise presentation\nPM - 45 minute debrief for Discovery project team\nPM - Pay incentives, project admin wrap, distribute report\n\nMonday (26th)\n\nAM - Planning for next Sprint\nPM - Show and Tell - Wider stakeholders\nNow usually I don’t work Fridays due to compressed working hours, but this project was quite intense so despite working long hours mid-week and with support from the team it wasn’t actually possible to get it all done in Mon-Thurs; this has left me rather cream-crackered this weekend!\n\n\n\nReflections on things I’ve learnt this year\nIt often is a hectic schedule in the design/research space on a national programme - policy changes frequently… and so the service design, interaction and content design change frequently too!\nUnderstandably when delivering at pace, some decisions would be difficult to make without any end user insight - user research while important can also be viewed as ‘a blocker’ if everyone is sat around waiting around for ‘an answer’. We don’t like our team to be perceived as slowing things down a lot (of course research does take some time) because more key decisions are then made without any research. We know where that happens assumptions and bias are more likely to creep in.\nDue to the concern of delaying progress on a key national service - I’ve spent a lot of time over the year trying to improve our research cadence and efficiency. Things like automated participant management (panels), standardising recruitment and interview scheduling approach, consistent analysis approaches, these have all sped things up. Another major benefit of consistent team and consistent approaches is when colleagues have to drop-in to support last minute there isn’t a ‘forming/storming/norming’ phase - everyone can just continues ‘performing’.\nAnother thing I’ve realised however is that, no matter how quick the research can be delivered, there is always another project (or 10!) waiting to be delivered as urgently. This usually becomes apparent just as the current one is wrapping up. To cope with constant pressure to deliver quality at pace we ask all our researchers to book time off regularly (including me), and to arrange ‘fire breaks’ every 4-5 weeks to ensure we have time to reflect, consolidate learnings and recover from working flat out!\n\n\nTL;DR\nThere are many significant challenges while delivery at pace on national systems, this has been particularly noticeable on systems that are central to the response for managing the Coronavirus pandemic.\nIt has been a fantastic experience to even be involved such a national effort; and I hope our research has made a positive contribution to improving things for end-users!\nI have huge respect for the amazing researchers across the many organisations I’ve collaborated with recently (NHS, Deloitte, Kainos, BJSS, Hippo Digital, and other contracting companies) they have all been giving it their everything and have delivered over 1,000 user interviews during the last year.\nIt feels like on Testing we’re all about ready for a long break - the barista at Costa tells me that on May 17th it’s all over! But who knows what this year will bring?\n\n\n\n\nLet me know what you thought below"

    "text": "Image: Fusion\n\n\nSo I have been a bit ill the last 3 weeks: first it was a terrible eye infection (lasting 5 days, requiring 3 different eye solutions!), then followed by a Covid-like/cold-like/flu-like symptoms and needing to isolate for another week, then followed by some minor food poisoning (2 days). Well bad things do happen in 3’s so hopefully I’ll be able to recover now for a little while. It has been pretty rubbish time, but my brilliant colleagues at work have been supportive throughout.\nI took a PCR the first week when some symptoms occurred, then 5 lateral flows mid week, then another PCR the following weekend as symptoms continued. All the tests came back negative so I suspect it is a seasonal flu bug going round.\nwhy no blogging? well, I have not stopped writing however I seemed to lose confidence in a few posts I wrote just at the end when I was about to publish. I don’t think they were that terrible, just they need a bit of revisiting/sanitising (content support / peer reviews welcome!!)\nThinking about the pandemic\nHearing from a well-known Covid expert on a talk show this week, and reviewing discussions the by healthcare people on social media, it is clear the ongoing debate about symptoms and ‘the evidence’ will continue hotly for weeks/months to come:\n\nwhat even are the symptoms of Covid?\nwhich are the most reliable indicators?\nwhich symptoms should be the clinical requirements to get a test?\n\nIt’s a really difficult design challenge as having a vague list of symptoms, or very long list of symptoms could lead to wider confusion, or panic. Also opening the floodgates could lead to unavailability of tests for people who have the main Covid symptoms. The fact tests are mainly free it is obviously quite expensive and there are always going to be pressures to ensure healthcare funding is spent wisely too.\nPersonally, recently I found testing and isolation quite a disruption. For example, hearing from school they have positive cases and kids off, but they can’t tell us any which class or group. They also don’t shut bubbles as before so things spread much more quickly. As schools are no longer doing any contact tracing it leaves families and teachers uncertain which class or bubble is impacted, or whether their kids are at any increased risk. Are the bugs coming home Covid? or something else? The frustration was compounded by having to fill in the 3 forms to request 1 box LFDs and 2xPCR home kits, plus 5xforms to register regular LFDs, plus 2xforms to register the PCRs. NHS Login saved me a little hassle, but it was still a lot of effort.\nI know it breaks the guidelines to use 2 x LFD tests on the same day, but I hear a lot of people are doing this before going out, or seeing vulnerable people. They then register them as being on alternative days, people know the tests are not very accurate so taking two increases likelihood of getting a right result. There have also been about 15-20 emails and the same amount of SMS messages to read. Then a new FlowFlex? LFD kit type to navigate which was fun. As a busy person I didn’t read any of the guidance, and I confess I’m pretty much hopelessly overconfident about most things so it went wrong. 2 of my tests resulted in nosebleeds (hopefully not brain damage?) and I found this out on Twitter several days after it happened that it may void the result so I took another test.\nMore generally, I think a lot about the bigger questions, and are we asking the right questions? e.g. Since so many people are now vaccinated are people still interested in getting tested? How much effort are people will to take to get tests and register tests? What is back to normality - is this the new normal? Or is more normal to come? “You’ve got to get people onboard with Testing” was a quote we heard last year from a participant.\nWe see in general public that mask wearing has dropped off almost completely, other public perception / monitoring studies suggest that other types of compliance have dropped too.\nDespite the levels of covid being stable for a while, then starting to fall, many health professions are anticipating another difficult winter. Vaccination levels are pretty high (could be better) but people say it will still be a really busy times ahead. It is almost inevitable, but can be very challenging for the teams and staff who have already been working on COVID on the front line of a pandemic response for 18 months. Service teams are dealing with the current policy changes (like international border policy announced last week) and no doubt need to implement many future changes we don’t know about yet, or are required over winter and spring period. The NHS is also really struggling to deal with the massive backlogs of non-covid related work and many staff are leaving from burnout.\n\nSomething positive things I’ve done recently - YAY\nI’ve been struggling to feel healthy after nearly 18 months at home, mostly alone. I love going to the running club but had a lack of motivation to meet up while covid cases locally have been quite high.. never break good habits they say. I feel think it’s time to get a new some new running shoes and watch, or to face the fear and start heading to the gym again… going for 1 short run this week has been a personal achievement (although I used to do this about 5 times a week running 20 miles or more!)\nWe’re looking to expand our team, and having spent 3 weeks meeting loads of contractors with a range of experience, we have found 3 who are keen to join at an exciting time for the team!!\nI’ve also recently started learning to code again. I previously learnt a fair bit about html/php/css/sql/analytics through blogging, community projects I’ve been involved in, and front-end design projects at work. I’m now doing a bit of a pivot away from front-end and starting look more into data science programming.\nTo me it’s feels that data science and user research are two massively separate bubbles right now: combining UX data of all types is major area of growth for service and product teams. UX researchers (now and in the future) really need to understand the principles and practicalities of quant data (beyond survey and analytics).\nMany of the main languages and tools (R, SQL, Python, etc) have been around a very long time, on previous attempts I found getting set up and then doing anything useful to be really difficult.\nIt’s also a huge and growing field to explore too, math/ CS / DS / ML / DL / AI… to a newbie it can just feel massively overwhelming and very steep learning curve (multiple languages, hundreds of tools/frameworks, modules to consider).\nI would really like to do a full masters course (e.g. Msc Data Science) or similar, or even a 12-week online programme, however taking this much time away from work really isn’t an option for me right now.\nTo keep busy and motivated during no doubt another challenging winter I’ve made a mini-roadmap to get started and looking out for ideas for bitesize projects to think about in my limited spare time.\nWhile it feels like the toolsets and online learning resources are much more accessible and better structured than before.\nI’ve starting with amazon #1 python book Python Crash Course as it has a mix of interesting projects.\nIt would be great to hear from other people exploring this field, or to share resources for new starters etc, do get in contact on Twitter!!! :)\nHave a nice day!\nTom\n\n\nLet me know what you liked below"

    "text": "COP26 starts soon\n\n\n\nA rollercoaster fortnight\nCOP26 starts very soon, yes there will be testing. Over the past 3 weeks our team have been collaborating on and testing various digital service design proposals. The digital team typically found out about this requirement for event-testing over the weekend (from the news).\nWith the anticipation of many thousands of international arrivals coming to Glasgow very soon, the design team started cracking on with designing an ideal experience. Like rabbits in headlights, the team accepted the initial request to design, test, build and deploy an entirely new booking service - in under 2 weeks.\nOn second glance, and consulting the wider team, the team were doubtful if it was even possible. Risks were escalated to product owners, and the big bosses… after several discussions there was a decision to reuse all the things we already have. Phew I guess. Another team were voluntold-nicely to hurriedly redesign / make changes along several major user journeys.\n(Internal dialogue) Here we go again I thought… baking more edge cases into the main user flows. We know that all these forms were designed for UK citizens, some journeys are optimised for NHS app users, however none of these journeys were designed to support international residents. We know this means that multiple pages like Name, Phone Number, Address, GP/Doctor registration, and many more would need both content and form validation changes.\nAlongside the event, we knew we still need to fix a whole bunch of other problematic pages (designed around edge cases / or vague data requirements).\nOur regular in-house recruiter was off on annual leave that week so I picked up organising all the recruitment. The plan was to interview a mix of people relevant to all the changes we were making. Some people who would be arriving through borders, some people who have travelled abroad recently and taken a private test, some people who live in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and would be impacted by other regional changes.\nWe also did not want to interview retired people aged 50-70, savvy or expert internet users, and we have another tendency to steer away from interviewing too many white people; although these three previous factors make up the majority of users who join our panel. Within the UX community there is (rightly) a strong feeling that these groups are not representative of the wider population, communities and individuals with more diverse needs.\nThere are also access needs to consider too, we wanted to find people with limited English, or where English was their second language. Alongside this we want to find more users who have physical access needs, as we continue to explore the experience of users choosing a test site and to understand what access facilities they may need, and also to gather feedback on the physical accessibility of test kits. So it was complex recruitment brief to say the least. We dug deep into our panels and social networks/ Facebook groups, and found about 50 people of interest. 6 were booked for calls, but sadly only 3 turned up. Over the next day we resolved to do more, hastily reached another handful of users. Luckily in the next 2 days the team interviewed more users to add to the previous three.\n\n\nBreathe and Pause for reflection.\nThere is nothing more intriguing and insightful than being an observer or assessor for an NHSX or GDS assessment panel.\nOver the last few weeks I was lucky to get to do both of these. I’ve sat on the other side as lead researcher on multiple national programmes and I know it can be very stressful experience. Luckily, long gone are the days when service assessment panels had vast powers and could force big changes (like closing down ‘failing’ services). Assessments these days are more like peer-reviews with a non-exec board / expert team. While the feedback can still be fairly critical, it is provided as guidance for teams to improve. Assessments also provide assurance, connect dots and align services.\nIt was a tough week. The first assessment I observed had a strong emotive topic, and a lot of major issues came out through this process. In the end the service did not meet the criteria.\nThe second service, which I was user research assessor for struggled quite a bit too. The result wasn’t helped by the team not having a dedicated user researcher within their team throughout Discovery and Alpha. Despite this, the team had done loads of great work and I reflected hard on what feedback to provide, changing my recommendations several times over 5 days.\nIt felt like this particular team had been pressurised into continuing rapidly through a very short (3 week) discovery, with the plan to go straight into alpha and then a private-beta phase. There were some brilliant elements of work and collaboration across several complex organisations, but some aspects were problematic too. With some focussed effort I’m sure they could improve things quite quickly. The major issue from not having a researcher is that the team relied heavily on their own and partner organisations expertise. Lots of internal workshops, mapping out user journeys - but very limited qualitative research with end users.\nAt an alpha assessment, I would hope teams present some artefacts/slides (for about 20 minutes) talking about their users, the range of discovery activities conducted, and plans for the next stage. Hopefully concluding like Sherlock or Poirot with an ‘aha’ moment - identifying a clear problem statement to solve, sharing a set of (solution-agnostic) users needs, and a research plan to follow through alpha and Beta.\nUnfortunately this didn’t happen and the team may need to go back round parts of the loop and do a bit more in-depth discovery and triangulation of insight, alongside continuing to work on ‘an important’ thing.\n\n\nHiring again\nLately there has been a lot of discussion about how hard it is to recruit and retain UX talent.\nIn my experience it hasn’t been too difficult, to find great people. The key factors being have a team with a clear mission, an effective processes for finding people, being inclusive of applications from all communities, providing new joiners with a great onboarding experience, being ongoing supportive, having the right tools and collaboration environments. Team work makes the dream work.\nAnother exciting thing this week was seeing the significant amount of interest in the number of applicants to NHSD perm-roles that are part of the latest UCD recruitment drive. As part of the sifting panel I reviewed over three-dozen applications. There were some really strong candidates, both internal and external; it goes to show that working in health (despite the pandemic) is still a major draw.\n\n\nLooking after me\nIt’s been a difficult few weeks for me, reading all the media and press about ‘Plan B’, masking up, rising cases, hospitalisations and deaths. Having been on Covid Testing / Test and Trace since April 2020 to me it feels like I’ve seen and heard it all before.\nResearchers and other scientists are saying the data shows that cases are going down, but we must remember that cases also went down everywhere just ahead of the previous summer, half-term and Easter holidays. Obviously a few weeks after that, when schools returned there were post-holiday outbreaks. Also earlier in the year in Cornwall the was another outbreak, although nothing to do with the large-scale events happening near July time. More outbreaks have occurred after everyone returns from international holidays in 2020 and 2021. Just because testing or cases numbers drop for a few days or weeks, doesn’t necessarily mean things are actually changing for the positive.\nIt might be getting better, or it might be getting a bit worse, it might also be about to get really quite a lot worse. We just don’t know yet. The data is always lagging a few days or weeks behind reality. The Zoe app data is currently showing the big outbreak spikes for some regions, being led by case rises in under 20s.\nBehaviour changes can make a massive difference too. Lockdown and isolation is really really hard, I just did that for 10 days after being ill and some more days after with my kids were off school with Covid. I wouldn’t judge any parent who thinks, you know what I can’t afford to spend my 1 week half-term holiday locked inside with my kids. Despite there being massive outbreaks in primary and secondary schools mentally they may not feel able to stay inside, so in order to avoid testing positive they decide not to test as regularly, or only if symptomatic. The is quite an understandable and predictable albeit very short-term-focussed behaviour: being trapped inside is stressful, maybe they are lonely, people desire to see friends and family, or to be outdoors before winter kicks in.\nThe testing programme can encourage uptake by reducing barriers and further simplifying experiences, providing more support channels, etc. However, in the end acceptance/compliance with guidelines and individual personal responsibility and local community-driven health interventions can make bigger differences.\nCovid attention and compliance is wearing pretty thin right now.\nYouGov data shows 58% say that would wear a mask in public (was 76%, 39% avoid crowded places (was 80%).\nONS stats are slightly more optimistic, with 8 in 10 saying they wore a mask last week.\nHowever this academic paper reviews many studies, and it shows that around 18% of symptomatic people isolated (pg17) during August, while only 12% of symptomatic people got a test (pg22).\nMany tools for testing, tracing and isolation are already out there, either free or very much affordable right now - we know everyone is desperate for normality: but normality at what cost?\nGetting really ill with long-covid can be just as traumatic and detrimental for patients, as for those who have been acutely unwell and hospitalised with Covid. I would love to get back to normal, and was feeling more confident that we were passed the latest peak. Then the next week so many stories went around about people who despite being vaccinated were getting long covid. That was really worrying to hear.\nFor policy it is a lose-lose situation right now too, either implement more measures/lockdown and the bustling economy takes a hit, or stay open and healthcare system and patients do. The NHS is already under pressure from all the delayed operations, etc, GPs report they are bursting with other physical and mental health problems from the first 2 waves - they can’t feasibly be checking out for everyone who may or may not have Covid too. We hear in the news that teachers in some areas are picking up additional health responsibilities, like testing; how is it sustainable, or ‘normal’?\nBeyond the numbers going up and down as they do, we need services to be designed more empathetically and holistically - considering the entire care pathway.\nIdentifying appropriate measurable goals is really important too: 320 million tests is a very big and remarkable number but that is just another vanity metric - it only goes up: identifying symptomatic and positive people is a real measurable.\n\nDid the right people in the right places get tested?\nHow many were missed?\n\n\n“Trace is just another service/verb: isolating individuals and families that are contagious is the real goal/outcome.”\n\nThe billion dollar question is: How might we demonstrate if testing, tracing and isolation has had an significant impact on reducing the R-rate?\nThe latest PAC report is critical around the lack of evidence of effectiveness. It’s really depressing reading this for internal teams who have been working very hard, asking the important questions but yet being told to focus sits with other priorities.\nAll this has been weighing on me quite a lot lately, since the second lockdown it seems through regular context-switching we’ve missed the window of opportunity to reflect from the past and make things a lot better for citizens.\nI’ve now stepped back from doing any frontline UR-deliver work, our research team has grown and new hires crack on with all the good stuff.\nAt the moment I focus on coordinating several research workstreams, cross-pollinating feedback and ideas, and playing the important unblocker-and-escalator role, alongside being an occasional narrator/historian/broken-record for the team.\nApril 2020 seems like a very very very long time ago. It’s been a long haul and I hope everyone is still doing well and finding a time to reflect too.\n\n\nLet me know what you thought below"

    "text": "This is a post about my recent experience working as a Senior User Researcher on Covid Testing, and as an interim-role taking on some new Lead User Research responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\nImage: Tim Johnson\n\n\n\nCrossing-the chasm\nIn the last few weeks, I’ve gone from managing a team of six researchers, to broadly overseeing three teams with 15 researchers (all contractors except myself).\nIt has been tough so far. The most challenging few weeks of my whole career.\nThis post covers some things I did, a few things that are going well and other areas where I hit the brick wall already.\n\n\nDelivering a World-Beating Service\nIt has been nearly two years working on Covid Testing for some staff like myself. The policy and service design has been changing on a very regular basis throughout the pandemic and the research team have supported all elements of Testing product/service lifecycle.\nThis means being involved in new project kick offs, assumption mapping, discovery research, service design ideation/reviews, accessibility reviews, testing solutions, monitoring feedback about the live service, resolving emerging issues, and much much more.\nOne tricky part of delivering UR for this service is knowing what direction to focus on next. Sometimes we hear about policy changes before they are announced, this really helps as we can start to shape discovery work that is required and pull together insights from previous studies.\nAt other times we find out only at the time policy changes are announced; this makes it incredibly hard to plan beyond a few weeks ahead. We’ve found working in Agile with a weekly cadence and a prioritised backlog of projects a flexible approach that doesn’t lock the research team into a fixed roadmap.\nThe Test Digital team have delivered 265~ rounds of research and ~1500 interviews. Additionally, many hundreds of adhoc thematic reports, design reviews, survey analysis reports, alongside commissioned projects.\nEvery piece of research has been different in scope, whether a change to the journey/service to support new use cases, or new interaction designs/content changes, or broader discovery.\nWith so many plates spinning, and new requests all the time and we have to be really selective about what to focus on next!\n\n\nEmpowerment and being the -umbrella\nEvery day, many new requests come into the research team. I became acutely aware that the team have already agreed with our stakeholders the highest priority projects to focus is. These are expert contractors, the A-Team, they are brilliant at UR delivery. Anything else that occurs outside the top few projects currently in flight is a big distraction that will reduce the teams overall success.\nI took responsibility on many occasions, to shield this team from problems. Whether it was taking an initial meeting with stakeholders, providing some quick turn-around analysis, attending workshops, service assessments, helping with technical problems, fetching some survey data. I saw it as a core part of this role to keep the team laser-focussed and stop broader distractions. I enjoy helping colleagues so this bit was quietly rewarding, but at times like an endless to-do list, with small-medium-sized problems to solve for colleagues each day.\nThe number of meetings and catch-ups however went up exponentially, I found myself triple booked on several occasions and couldn’t attend sessions. The team are always empowered and continue progressing projects without me; I hope joining half way through calls isn’t a problem. The number of adhoc Slack calls between meetings has gone up loads too. On no days in the last week did I have more than a 20-minute break, or time for lunch, never finishing before 6pm.\nI really struggled to get out for a walk or jog, only on a few occasions this happened recently. This is very ironic as I’m part of the Wellbeing Champions team, supporting a wider Wellbeing consultation on the programme, and I should certainly be encouraging colleagues to take more leave and regular breaks!!\n\n\nWorking with Programme managers & Becoming a Stakeholder\nThis was another major learning for me was that while operating across three teams, who manage totally different services, there is a considerable “Zooming out” required.\nI was becoming one of our “difficult to reach stakeholders” with an impossible diary, gradually feeling more distant from the user research and unclear what the top problems to solve area. I attended a few sessions as an UR observer but found it really hard not to get distracted, or to steal some time back to answer some emails.\nI’ve also had to adapt my communication style working directly with the programme managers. I feel a bit newb-like in that space, and it may take a while to build up more trust in their management processes and confidence operating at that level. The discussions are much more philosophical and open ended – where are we going? Are we doing ok? I’ve mostly been listening for direction and to get a feel for their approach, but often programme managers don’t have the answers either so ask you for a view.\nI’ve noted here I need to be even more direct about the problem and have some evidence to hand and/or research options ready to fill gaps in insight. It is hard to build up much of a narrative with the team if you are constantly context switching between meetings; there may only be a 5-minute window and one chance to get a key point across with very senior management stakeholders.\nTo help with this communication challenge, and to support feeling very Zoomed-out I started working on a new dashboard to help myself and other stakeholders to (very quickly) digest what are the priority issues in play across the services and what are we doing about it. This is still work in progress and I need to find a way that the team can help manage the dashboard alongside their workload. The idea is we could do a regular ‘weather report’ about what are the top issues going on and how we are doing about resolving them.\n\n\nHiring\nThe most significant part of my time (and for the SURs on the team) so far has been spent reviewing candidate CVs, interviewing researchers, evaluating potential & fit within the team, providing feedback to candidates, and negotiating terms and start dates for new starters.\nWe had many CVs, a really bizarre mix of experience and qualification levels. The team already are pretty experienced, so mainly we are looking for practitioners who deliver complex UR projects to a good quality as well as being confident while working with stakeholders.\nThese individuals are very hard to find at the moment, UX demand is pushing up day rates to very high-levels. A few hours delay reviewing CVs can result in missing interesting candidates. We do have new joiners on their way, which is really exciting for the team and it will be great to have fresh eyes looking at the challenges.\n\n\nOnboarding\nFor all new starters, we need to ensure proper onboarding happens. In the past this has been critical to the successful growth of the team. Onboarding includes introductory sessions with the UR team, wider design and product teams, walk through journeys, providing reading materials/research reports, arranging a buddy, observation sessions, supporting tasks, access to IT systems, sharing whereabouts of documentation, providing technical guidance for tools, invites to team meetings, UR community meetings, and probably many more things too!! I’m actually looking forward to going over this again in the next few weeks, I’ve done it before and it feels like safe ground.\nRetros & Continuous improvement As part of delivering better quality work, quicker access to insights, faster turnaround, we have had to continually refine and improve our own processes. This is typically managed through regular UR team Retros twice a month, as well as project specific Retros/ Reflection sessions.\nNot everyone enjoys retros. If the host is not careful there is risk it ends up being critical of individuals work, which is not the point. Our team are extremely collaborative and constructive and many problems we have experienced have later been resolved in a timely manner after a retro. We are now planning a Retro of Retros, to review our progress on the issues identify over the past 6 retros.\nOur retros result in activities within our research backlog, these are allocated to the Seniors, Re-ops colleagues, and occasionally UR practitioners if they have availability between prioritised projects.\n\n\nWellbeing and Socials\nAs you can imagine the whole team are really tired. Some colleagues have felt ready for change and already decided moved on, it’s really difficult to hear this when they hand notice, but it is very difficult to ask for more as they have personally given up so much for the team already. Yes I’ve cried three times in the last month when colleagues left us.\nI’ve personally considered the same things on many days over the last 18 months - when even is a good time to move team? when do you need a proper break? I was the first joiner to the Covid Testing team and it feels like riding the waves out towards the end would be nice. But when will it end? For citizens and our users, the service may continue on for months, or years, we just don’t really know what is happening with this pandemic.\nBeing a key-person on the A-Team service delivering for 60 million people is stressful but exciting for anyone involved. Several colleagues who left have told me how they find the new roles unrewarding and slow, feeling less impactful.\nOthers have told me this is the most important and fulfilling job we might ever have, so why would anyone want to step aside from that? It’s a difficult personal choice and I totally respect anyone who works on these services whether for a few months, a year or more.\n\n\nPerformance management\nNot everything went well with staff in our team. Several contractors who have been on the project for a while had to be let go.\nProblems had started slowly with a few tasks not being completed, or work to the expected quality, but things gradually started to get worse as time went by.\nI really tried to work through challenges with individuals where possible, having more regular catch-ups, arranging additional technical training, breaking down working into smaller chunks, creating SMART objectives with mutually agreed deliverable dates, and regular reviews against goals.\nEventually things grew into larger problems and it starts drawing attention from the wider team. Other contractors get a bit frustrated if others are not keeping up and not contributing to the meetings and outputs.\nWhat I learnt around the performance management is the best approach seemed to be honesty and transparency – i.e. to have early and very open discussions with those involved in a situation like this, whether the individuals, their line managers, HR, the hiring team, supplier/agency. Don’t assume anything, try to understand the whole situation, appreciate challenges individuals are going through, coach where possible, individuals may even want to leave but are staying on for other reasons.\n\n\nOffboarding\nIf people are leaving try not to make this a surprise to the team.\nRecent departures in the team fit into three categories:\n\nThe good - staff leaving for new pastures on good terms,\nThe ok - staff leaving at short notice on good terms, but without a replacement arranged yet,\nThe bad - staff leaving for contractual or performance issues.\n\nLeaving gifts, Kudoboards, leaving socials is whole new area of specialty that I’ve now learnt about. It takes some effort to organise a proper goodbye for staff who have delivered brilliant stuff over long time periods. Some of our internal and external colleagues who left ages ago I still really miss and we would certainly hire them back any day.\nIt is never simple. There was some conflict here as the business have a strong belief contracting staff should deliver the work to expected quality as soon as they have onboarded.\nI found it difficult letting staff go, but it was important for individuals involved to know the outcome, and vital for the wellbeing and performance of the wider team, to move the situation forward.\nI tried to resolve issues and delayed things a week to consider the situation, and provided flexibility during staff notice periods. Personally, I found this process difficult to reconcile against the broader commitments to build a diverse and inclusive workforce, and to provide support and empowerment for colleagues enabling them to grow as well.\n\n\nTL;DR\nIn summary, I’ve recently been exposed to, and fully absorbed in, a previously invisible world happening offstage in the UX industry.\nThe coal-faces of “human resource management” and “programme leadership teams”, which make up a large part of the Lead User Research role.\nI’ve not decided yet if I liked what I’ve seen, or if this change towards people management is something I would learn to enjoy.\nI imagine this is the same journey footballers go through later becoming a coach and/or team manager. It’s just another rocky road, bit different, and you can continue if it meets your needs.\nThere is really is limited guidance/support for SURs progressing towards LUR level, particularly what is needed around managing very complex programmes of research, stakeholders needs, and particularly the likely staffing challenges ahead.\nThis is something I hope to share more about in future posts as I learn more myself.\nI have several individuals I see as mentors who I reach out to discuss difficult situations like this. I’m happy for anyone in a similar situation to contact me if they need someone to share ideas with too!\n\n\nLike to know more? let me know below"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Image: Anne Spratt\n\n\n\nFeels like the end of an era\nThis week is my last week on Covid Testing programme after 2 years 3 months (since March 2020)!\nI’ve had the pleasure of meeting and working with so many brilliant, dedicated, passionate and talented colleagues. It has been the best team ever.\nWhen I first joined the programme, the previous BRAM project I was on was cancelled by Covid. Like many staff from across the Civil Service, I was sent home one afternoon with no certainty of what I would be doing next.\nOver the next few days, I was loaned out to a nascent “health start-up” called Covid Testing, later to become the biggest “health enterprise” ever created - Test and Trace.\nSomehow when the music-stopped I had landed in the right-place-at-the-right-time. With all the chaos going on across the world, including my family being affected by Covid through March, it was a privilege to join a team in a role where I could directly improve things for citizens and users, during the biggest national health emergency for generations.\nThe first six months were honestly overwhelming, fascinating, exhausting and often traumatising. A very small team worked at pace, under the national burden of pressure to do the right thing, to deliver quickly, the best work we have ever done.\nI learnt so much about citizen behaviours, which have often been unpredictable throughout the pandemic. For example, during the first weekend of Key Worker testing, dozens of frightened members of the public rang my work mobile asking for help. The service was spun-up so fast there was no Service Desk and people found my details in the small print of a survey. Everyone was desperate for help.\nFrom our remote working environment, finding out what was happening on the ground was at times very challenging. We had discussions about the ethics of ‘mystery shopping’ tests sites, where the virus was probably present; how could we justify this risk? considered the risk to others, how could we not?\nWith sheer grit, very long hours, and remote collaboration we got a lot of things done. The team sustained this pace for well over a year and Testing scaled from Zero to an average of 1.2 million tests per day.\nAfter the second wave in 2020, I thought I was done; I never thought I would stay on T&T this long. However, colleagues convinced me it was a great team, and that it might be the most important project we ever work on. I found a renewed motivation to drive-the-team forward and following my professional development goals taking on new responsibilities (as well new hobbies to keep sane!).\nT&T was a very complex stakeholder environment, there was always a need to be transparent, evidence-based and to align teams around a shared vision to get things done. I’ve been able to put a broad range of professional skills into practice, scaling UR teams, research-operations, managing larger teams, research ethics, quality management, influencing change, alignment and facilitation between teams, knowledge management, building a resilient team, helping the team manage stress / anxiety / trauma, and much more.\nThe research team and stakeholders we work with should take a lot of pride from their contributions. There were hundreds of times that research and insights contributed to making a real positive change for citizens. For example, the research contributed towards: helping to increase the inclusion and accessibility of the service, improve usability of physical and digital service channels and Test kits, drive positive health outcomes through rapid diagnosis and isolation, helping to keep Key Workers, the public, and organisations safe through free-testing.\nIt will likely take me several weeks/months to really decompress and reflect on the broader impact and outcomes from the 300+ rounds of research during this time.\nBetween 16th May-6th June I’ll be taking some time off and transferring teams again, this time to join the Central UCD Team at NHS Digital in the position of Lead User Researcher.\nI’m super excited and slightly anxious about starting a new chapter!\nTom\n\n\nLike to know more? let me know below"

    "text": "TL;DR\nI wrote a long post about coparenting/being a single/solo dad and my personal journey through getting divorce. I deleted that and wrote these concise thoughts instead.\n\n\n\nImage: Mary\n\n\n\n\nThoughts about parenting rights\nAs a society, we need to find better language to describe parenting / families. Not all parents whether single, separated, married, divorced, widowed, in a partnership, or have a new partners etc. are in the same situation.\nEvery parent has different support networks, childcare commitments, restrictions, flexibility and needs.\nIt is much better to ask directly what their situation is like, than assume.\nThe quiet parents who never mention their family are probably struggling the most.\nMany dads get a raw-deal from the courts during separation and divorce proceeding, and in solicitor negotiations.\nSadly this is because a minority of dads won’t see their kids, or won’t payany contributions towards their kids upbringing after divorce.\nObviously it is not the case for majority of dads, but due to a minority, most dads will get the raw deal.\nChild maintenance payments can be a large % of income, you might be restricted access to kids only on certain dates/times of the week, and may receive no child benefit (as not the ‘non-resident parent’), along many other issues.\nParenting rights is a controversial and taboo subject, but for the sake of equality and bringing fathers rights into the 21st century, the topic needs more research and debate.\nPersonally, I feel courts shouldn’t use edge-case behaviours to punish all the dads.\nBy default, it could be shared custody, equal rights and equal access to their kids for both parents, rather than mothers preferences taking preference.\nThe mental health, physical well-being and economic burdens the current system puts on divorced dads is significant, overwhelming, traumatic, and, mostly under-documented.\nIf you don’t believe this, look at the stats:\n\n“Divorce statistics can be wildly bleak: Ten divorced men commit suicide each day — a rate at least three times higher than that of divorced women.”\n\nSources:\n\nfatherly.com/health-science/psychological-effects-divorce-fathers-men-suicide\nstowefamilylaw.co.uk/blog/2017/09/09/ending-it-all-divorce-and-suicide/\nhashimashi.com/suicide-after-divorce/\n\nIt’s also worth reading about the great work of #fathers4justice, and campaigns around parental alienation awareness too.\n\n\nHow’s Tom?\nPersonally, I’m doing o.k. now several years on after a challenging separation & divorce. It was terrible at times, where I felt very depressed, struggling on many days\nTo ‘survive’ the divorce, and now to ‘survive’ another 12+ more years in this situation before my kids grow up… well that is a really long haul - a life goal?\nIt’s such a heavy burden to work full time, raise your kids solo, even when you don’t see them as often as you may like.\nWorking to survive: mortgage and household bills, school and hobby costs, child maintainance, saving for kids future… well there’s not much left, right?\nIf any dads are going through similar, DM on @thomashallam, lets chat. Take care!\nTom\n\n\nLike to know more? let me know below"

Click here to return to the front page.\n\n\n\nImage: Rene Bohmer\n\n\nIt’s been 10 years since I was attacked and bitten by two dogs while out running.\nI can still remember that day, the pains, the hospital, the police, the dogs, their owner. It took a long time to get over what happened, and I quit running for many months after that incident.\nSadly, something similar happened again last week}{.external target=“_blank”} (trigger warning: graphic image of dog bite). In another unprompted incident, a dog (being walked on a lead) bit me as I went by on the pave, the owner did not acknowledge the incident, and just walked off.\nI should have taken a picture of the dog and owner, or followed them to check where they live, but the shock and blood running down the inside of my trousers meant I had other things on my mind. I wasn’t really thinking as normal at that precise moment.\nAnyway, suffice to say, despite the walker mentioning the dogs name to be Dexter, none of the other dog walkers in the village have come forward with the owners name, so far. I shared what happened on our local facebook group too, to see if anyone knew anything, and the police are looking into to it. Two neighbours told me they know a local dog with this name but would not reveal the owner.\nParents in the village and at school were rightly concerned; an adult is bitten near the top of the hamstring, could have easily been a child’s face.\nIt not until you have been traumatised and then retraumatised, that you realise how quickly and sharply these anxieties and mental health struggles can return.\nSeveral colleagues have kindly offered support and pointed me towards NHS counselling, I really appreciate this help - I haven’t as I have my own coping mechanisms, writing blogs such as this, swimming, and taking time to reflect, helps me to process it all.\nAfter two days in bed recovering from a Tetanus Jab and strong side effects (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/3-in-1-booster-side-effects/), body aches, muscle pains, swollen glands, joint pains), I’m hopeful the physical wounds will heal up quickly and not scar this time.\nAs for the mental effects, I’m officially avoiding contact with animals/pets for the next 3 months.\nTwo things I did notice this week, while seeking care for myself:\nthat NHS is certainly very busy, extremely. 111 phone lines, access to GP/nurse appointments, 5 hours waits at Urgent walk-in centres, it is clear the NHS is really struggling to cope. ‘We don’t have the staff’ was the nurses response. It does make you wonder, when you work in NHS ICT, whether teams efforts are being directed to ‘transform the things’ in areas seeing the biggest impacts on the ground’ Covid-restrictions/precautions, within healthcare is certainly patchy. Some GP practices and pharmacies (in rural and suburbs) were encouraging mask wearing and providing hand gel. At an inner-city walk-in centre no masking is required and so none of the hundreds of patients waiting there (for up to 5 hours) were wearing masks. My urgent takeout was to remind my kids to stop using their beds as a trampolines! Not injuring themselves is very important, because the hospital is very busy, possibly shut on weekends (I’m also hearing stories of patients with serious breathing difficulty waiting many hours and being turned away too).\n\nLike to know more? let me know below"

Evidence-based and UCD-led approaches that are helping to shape the way teams work, to increase UCD maturity (great work Lucy)!\nI presented an update on NHS Digital Panel Management Strategy – I’m not even sure how that went, would be interested to hear feedback. It was really lovely to see colleagues in person after 2 years sitting behind a screen! After years without any face-to-face presentations, I was feeling very anxious and out of my comfort zone at the start. Luckily this went away quickly when hecklers started and I just cracked on.\nIt would have been nice to introduce new research colleagues at the start, and have a bit more time for networking. However, with covid hospitalisation levels near peak levels I imagine networking was probably to be discouraged. This event already had been cancelled twice several times due to covid, so I guess a necessary compromise.\nA few of the other talks were quite in depth. Training talk on Safeguarding was a bit too close to home at times. For me this would have worked better in person with a small group, and more time to decompress. It felt like an overload of (important) policy guidance and highlights of some potentially difficult or traumatic incidents to watch out for/avoid. I came away feeling pretty upset following my recent dog-bite incident and well as personally feeling quite vulnerable at time as a solo dad surviving beyond divorce.\nHad a lovely lunch break with colleagues Claudio and Tanja who continue to inspire me with their motivation to crack on delivering loads of great work, despite their teams going through lots of interesting structure and supplier changes.\nDoh - forgot to take pictures of the team or venue. if anyone has any photos do share!\n\nLike to know more? let me know below"

Welcome!\nI’ve decided to close down my previous projects due to several things: ongoing hack attempts, increasing hosting costs, reduced time to manage servers. Using Wordpress for 10 years I’ve learn so much about websites/cloud/apps/dev/data/security, however for my blog i’ve decided the needs are quite simple so using Quarto is a good way to go.\nI’ll gradually be migrating some of the content over from my old blog and Medium. This will continue to be a space where I share how things are going for me, at work and outside\nAll the comment discussion threads are now powered by the Giscus App which is brilliant!\nDo share what you would like to hear more about :)\nThanks for reading\nTom\n\n\n\n\nIf you found this useful post a thumbs up below"

    "text": "Some positive news\n\n\nWe’ve been working hard to increase awareness of the User Centred-Design Maturity Model, Self-Review Workshops, and Community of Practice. Things were abit slow over the summer months, but gradually things really started to take off. A few larger teams are super keen and booked in lots of workshops, and rightly so some of our teams are skeptical “what another 3 hour workshop?” It does take a while to build up trust and explain the benefits. It is not for our UCD leaders and workshop faciliators to push for workshops too hard, we take a coaching approach and the tool is a self-review process… the evidence of impact can be heard loudly from the great feedback from teams have taken part about the positive changes it has supported them to make.\nThe ‘Reseaarch Panels Best Practice’ workstream is starting to deliver positive outcomes. We’ve designed new way of communicating and recruiting healthcare staff and “professional users”. A pilot has been completed with over 50 staff signing up for the new panel. We’re next working on a comms plan to roll out the service for all our researchers shortly!\nAnti-Racism Allies training - this training (run by HEE) got me reflecting quite deeply on my own personal history and where I grew up. There were some really nice people on the course. Note all the course attendees were white managers from the NHS and our cohort will meet up during 6-month programme. I’m hopeful that I can learn more about myself, gain some wider perspectives, and understand how I can be a better ally in the future.\n\n\nChallenges and puzzles this week\n\n\nTaking on way too much. Our UCD-Ops team is really small, there are so many teams that need help and the problems are often very complex. I really really (really really) enjoy helping people and it gives a great boost when we hear positive feedback from colleagues after helping them, we just want to help more. However, I realise that by helping people all the time it can be a burden on myself, and the team. We’ve talked about pushing back more and what can we do to ensure everyone gets a fair amount of help and they become self-sufficient. We’re looking at ways our team can better signpost help to reduce the number of repeated request.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me know what you liked below"

    "text": "Some positive news\n\n\nThe Leeds User Research Lab. Everything is in place to launch this venue for our colleagues to use very soon. It has been a real long road, with so many hurdles to overcome; it was quite an emotional time when we received our training and supplier handover last week. This week I visited again to test out everything we learnt, I plugged in all the equipment and clicked the ‘Start’, ‘Record’ and ‘Go Live’ buttons on the controls. Everything worked as anticipated such a relief!\nBehind the scenes we’ve been ‘doing the hard work’ on our Knowledge Management/Documentation/Policies to support our teams and colleagues during the merger. These resources will help ensure things aren’t lost in transmission but also supports scalability as the organisations align. We’re always looking to collaborate and if teams have resources they can happily feed them into our documentation process.\nMeeting a key supplier. We’ve been working together remotely for many years, so it was great to finally meet the supplier for a brief chat in Leeds and share more about the context in which we work and opportunities to improve the relationship between our researchers and support teams.\n\n\nChallenges and puzzles this week\n\n\nI was super busy over half-term with family and work. I’ve booked 3 days off to repair my mental health and tidy up some things. I’ve personally been through some difficult times during the past few years; I’m not sure I have the mental capacity to go deep thinking at this time. It is so much pressure just to be a good adult role model for 2 kids every day, and run a tight ship; my own needs are to relax, enjoy life and learn how to build trust in people again.\nCoping with a recent loss in the family.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me know what you thought below"

    "section": "Thoughts about the new role",
    "text": "Thoughts about the new role\nThis role and the projects have been much more complex than I expected!\nPositives:\n\nIt was a considerable change for me - after 12 years work on ‘frontline research’, to move into a more strategic role focussed on capability development\nI’ve learnt loads about how things work from an ‘organisational perspective’, rather than ‘what happens from the delivery teams perspective’\nThe Central UCD Teams are really brilliant, great personalities, brilliant experience and have diverse perspectives\nFinding some greenfields to work in: starting projects from scratch, defining the goals and timelines\nWorking with the team and UR Leadership community to shape and prioritise our roadmap\nThe focus is on quality and outcomes rather speed/quantity\nInteresting player/coach mix - leading discovery and alphas vs. UCD Maturity coaching\nThe support and guidance available from colleagues in the team, as well as new training opportunities\nFound time to contiune to support DHSC as an UR Service Assessor\nWorking on technically complex projects, and working with lots of teams and stakeholders\nIt’s not been quite as stressful as Covid Testing, projects are given the time they need\n\nChallenges:\n\nCoordinating change across disporate groups and teams can take a lot of time. E.g. to understand their needs and taking them on a journey: reflection, alignment, action planning, delivery, etc. It can easily take 3-6 months before change and positive outcomes happen on these workstreams.\nSo many project - taking on too much……. stemming the tide of requests. Needing to practice better prioritisation and saying no to more requests! Finding ways to automate things!\nChoosing which battles to fight has never been more important, defining clear roles and responsibilities (e.g. local UR leads should do this bit, or the central team will do that)\nBeing dropped into a politically complex NHS programme ‘100-day discharge challenge’. Due to delays in starting the work there was no time for actual discovery. Saved the project by running a complex follow-up survey with Qualtrics for 150 Trusts/CCIOs. It worked out well for the project but was very stressful, and it didn’t provide much benefit for the Central UCD Team or UR community\nFeeling a bit disconnected from frontline… turning this around to believe (and demonstrate) how what we do in the Central UCD Team for the professions and organisational strategy has a direct impact on patient care. “Better capability, better delivery, better outcomes”\nGoing from having a large team of contractors to manage, into having no direct reports. I.e. there are no ‘juniors URs or URs to delegated directly to’ - everything must be done through leadership, influencing, pursuasion of the community and colleagues!"

    "text": "Projects\n\nUCD Maturity\nI’ve hosted the UCD Maturity Community of Practice (which enables peer-support between teams), chaired UCD Maturity workshops, and provided UCD-coaching and guidance to teams as required.\nChallenges:\nThis project was really difficult to get started. Picking up work that hasn’t been looked at for several months since the agency who created the maturity model rolled-off. A few teams had done workshops to test the UCD model, but this was 6-months before I joined!\nSince joining the team, I faciltated meetings of the Community of Practice (CoP) every 3 weeks. We started with some reflection activities to learn about what colleagues wanted to get out this community, and create a shared agenda from their.\nThe CoP identified lots of challenges/blockers to rolling out UCD-Maturity workshops to all teams:\n\nIt’s difficult to build engagement across ‘non-delivery’ teams\nLots of teams are still sceptical: what is UCD about? what benefits? a 3 hours workshop?\nTeams unavailbility: summer holiday, mourning of the Queen, challenging delivery schedules\nCompeting agendas: product maturity/product mindsets, engineering maturity, etc.\nOrganisational merger / team restructures\n\nThe Community of Practice, and UCD Maturity Faciltators are great! very supportive of each other!\nOne push-back we get is there is a risk we are preaching to the converted. UCD maturity reviews are not mandated, so some teams are many miles off the UCD-grid, and are not volunteering up to being involved at all. To scale things up we do need more consistent encouragement from senior programme managers/directors as well as champions/practitioners within teams to offer up the idea of doing a workshop.\nAlso to get these teams onboard we need to provide stronger evidence for how UCD Maturity workshops benefit teams. So we aim to run an evaluation study/survey with all the teams/colleagues who took part to understand the benefits.\nPositives:\n\nUCD Maturity Community of Practice growing, including interest from outside UCD\nUCD Maturity Training - attended by 15 colleagues\nWorkshops - we’ve run workshops with 5 teams since I joined\n1 face-to-face workshop has been planned\nInterest from external teams, NHS organisations and consultancies\n5 more teams are planning workshops\nPositive feedback from the 3 most recent workshops!\nTeams who work on Data/APIs commenting “Good to see how UCD can apply to their work too!”\n2 teams who took part recently, being very proactive and creating the action plan without any support\n\n\n\n\nActing as an SME for UCD/UR within the Central Ops team\nI’ve helped launch the UR Lab!\nQualtrics (expert user and IG lead)\nAs the IAA “Information Asset Assistant” Things that i’ve been working on:\n\nReviewing the IG protocols and enhancing these to meet the needs\nResolving technical issues that teams have that cannot be resolved within the team\nInterfacing with software supplier and customer support\nResolving issues regarding IG/Cyber, with Enquires team and corporate teams\nFixing problems with really complex surveys and contact databases\nTraining, coaching and a shoulder to cry on for survey makers\nWorking with Qualtrics team to improve support for our researchers\n\nIncentives\n\nI’ve supported the rollout of the new incentives portal\nI’ve lobbied for the needs of UR community, to be represented in incentives policy, getting finance directors to approve policy changes\nI’m Lobbying for NHSD UR community at the X-gov ALB Payments Committee meetups\nI’ve drafted new policy on incentives for healthcare staff (non-citizen research), which is being piloted\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge management\nThis project has been much more complex than I expected\n\nIt’s hard to put a price on the value of knowledge and documentation right?\n\n\n“Why spend any effort writing processes for UCD? when you could instead hire someone else to write some code for a health service?”\n\n\n“How do we know that standard procedures are useful? Our teams survived for the last decade year without a ‘playbook’”\n\nThese are interesting perspectives, and I guess there are a few benefits to having a low-documentation culture, it encourages creativity!!\nI’m sure across the business have over:\n\n100 ways to create a research consent form,\n100 different persona designs,\n100 survey variations,\n100 research plans,\n100 show and tells decks.\n\nALL DIFFERENT!\nIG processes are not consistent across teams, and without any standardisation/or ‘good practice guidance’ the quality and success of UCD across teams has become massively variable (good and bad)!\nSome teams do improve what they are doing gradually over time but it can take many years. For new teams starting from scratch with no healthcare or government research experience, it can be very daunting.\nEvery product team that wants to hire a researcher, and for every contractor that arrives, and every time someone leaves we get the same questions.\n\n“What do we need to do?” “How do we do this?” “Where is this? I can’t find that?” “How did we do this last time?” “Is there a template?” “Who knows what projects are happening?” “Has this work been done before?” “Where are those previous insights?” “What do we put things when we leave?”\n\nAs I joined the team in May, we didn’t have any Standard Operating Procedures/templates for research delivery; so it is a very long road to turn this around!\nWith the pandemic forcing everyone to remote work, we’ve been going through a fair bit of creative destruction with teams throwing out their old ways of doing things and finding new solutions.\nHowever, as things with Covid calmed down, more teams are getting back into the offices to gain the benefits of face-to-face collaboration. There are increased opportunities for cross-team information sharing.\nWork on knowledge management completed:\nBefore I joined the team:\n\nDiscovery completed\nGap analysis of guidance content completed\nPrioritised 4 areas of focus (ethics, safeguarding, consent, IG)\n\nAfter I joined the team:\n\nExpanded scope of priority documentation (UR lab, research panels, UCD, discovery, alpha, surveys)\nImproved structure and usability of the Sharepoint sites/sub-sites\nProposed and piloted a new information architecture\nStarted collecting examples of documentation off teams\nCreated and shared new guidance based around researchers needs (e.g. staff incentives policy, f2f research policy)\n\nThis project is a long-haul and as a team we’re chipping away at guidance and documentation. It takes some perservance. We’re continuing on a slow path towards documenting our UR/UCD procedures ahead of the merger with NHSE/HEE in 2023. It is going to be really important for scaling UR/UCD in an organisation with low UCD awareness.\nIt has also been great hearing positive feedback from UR colleagues and external Re-Ops colleagues about how impressed they are with the guidance and onboarding materials available for NHS Digital UCD colleagues.\n\n\n\nPanel Management strategy\n\nDiscovery - done\nAlpha - done\nPrivate beta - happening now\n\nI’ve previously written and presented about this project I’m leading to consolidate the many research panels we have into a single NHS Staff panel, with the benefit being a consistent data collection, standard IG processes and communications.\nIt has been an enjoyable project, with dozens of teams engaging in the discovery and design workshops I facilitated during alpha.\nAfter some gnarly technical problems, which we needed to engage the Qualtrics XM community to resolve, we are now ready to roll out on the panel to internal teams!\nAssuming the private beta goes well we’ll advertise the panel more widely and launch it properly for all the researchers later this year. I wrote a blog post about this work, but gave in when comms told me they already had 15 teams lined up to write a post.\nRegarding the work on a ‘Citizen Panel for Health’, which would bring together the many citizen contact lists that have grown across teams, unfortunately this has had to be paused due to re-prioritisation of the backlog.\nThere is some interesting work still happening in this space with the UKHSA Insights team and we are waiting to see how their project goes over the next few months before starting on what would we be a very similar project.\n\n\n\nMy goals for next few months\n\nRolling out the Staff Panel and UR Lab\nTry to get the blog post published about the panels work\nKeep positive about the UCD Maturity work. It was difficult to start but now has some momentum!\nSay no to more requests! Backlog is fully booked up till Jan/Feb\nSpeed up our knowledge management / BAU process for guidance and SOPs/templates\nComplete the Anti-Racism Allies training & Diamond Power Index 360 review\nKeep positive, in consideration of the organisation merger\nGet back into winter trail running (frosty toes running rather than frosty toes sitting at home!\nTake a good break over New Year\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue this discussion on GitHub"

Both very enthused by the lab and the tech!\nIt was good chance to pause and reflect with colleagues who have been involved in this long journey for three years building the UR lab during the pandemic.\nAll the technology stood up:\n\npeople had fun playing with the PTZ cameras,\nwe streamed the event for colleagues with MS Teams,\nwe tested running private web streams from both lab rooms,\nwe recorded what happened in the lab rooms to capture any feedback!\n\nIt was exciting to hear that several teams have projects coming up where they may be ready to use the venue, and hearing there is already interest from other health departments!!\nI imagine within a few weeks things will be fully booked up!\n\n\na long journey to this point…\nI’ve been involved throughout the whole NHSD UR Lab design journey since 2018/2019, playing a key role in:\n\nfacilitating the discovery of requirements with the User Research community\nunderstanding the art of the possible for the lab ** visiting x-gov labs and interviewing teams who manage labs - DWP, HMRC, GDS, HO, etc.\ndesigning the end-2-end user experience, for colleagues, participants, stakeholders\nworking closely with suppliers and internal teams such as: architects, av suppliers, buildings/estates, tech services/desktop hardware teams, comms team, security.\nassuring the quality of the building and facilities\ntesting all the equipment and providing documentation for the commmunity\n\n\n\n\nClicking all the buttons\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming challenges and puzzles\n“but I’m a starter, not often a finisher”\n…It was with a lot delight that we could launch the UR lab and lots of enthusiatic colleagues attended. However it is also a sad moment for me as 99% of the UR Lab challenges have now been resolved. With 14 years in research I always wanted to open a lab, and now I’ve accomplished that.\nThe UR Lab really needs a ‘duty manager’ to take it forward, i.e. someone who lives locally and has an interest in User Research e.g. a Graduate or Junior Researcher would be ideal.\nRunning this industry-leading lab on a day-to-day basis would be a great development opportunity for whoever takes on that kind of challenge.\nI know certaintly from running in-house labs during my the first five years of my research career at Dubit and then University of Leeds - working in a lab setting gives you great exposure to your customers, internal teams, their research methods, and usefully, important stakeholders too. The lab can be central to everything we do!\nIn person workshops\n…In a few weeks I’m travelling to London, which is rare and I’ve not been out to another big city in a long time (Feb 2020).\nPreviously I would have happily jumped on any train, travelled anywhere in the country, but after 2.5 years at home, everywhere else seems so blooming far away!\nI am really looking foward to the trip, meeting colleagues in our London teams for a big workshop, but just not these long train rides! Any suggestions for entertainment on the way is appreciated!\nAs always, any thoughts massively appreciated! :)\nTom\n\n\n\n\nLet me know what you thought below"

It outlines some commons challenges, decisions and risks that should be considered when hiring staff to work in this context.\n\n\n\nTo achieve a shared goal, we need a mix of skills! Image on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NHSE product strategy aims for all teams to follow User-Centred Design principles and approach (where applicable).\nUnderstanding customers needs and designing with our users in mind is an effective way to deliver great service outcomes.\nIt is a great ambition and this approach supports delivering the recommendations from the Wade-Geary review.\nOver the last six months I’ve hosted the User-Centred Design (UCD) Community of Practice. This has given me the chance to meet many teams and hear from colleagues about the challenges they face.\nThe User-Centred Design Maturity Model has also been a helpful tool for encouraging refection and debate in teams.\nTopics such as team structure, roles, ways of working and collaboration were common. A more sensitive topic that came up several times is do teams have an appropriate mix of staff (specialists and generalists).\nOne of the biggest concerns we hear about is when teams are made up of only generalists. Any assurance or spend-review process (DHSC-DTAB / CDDO-GDS Service Standards) will identify this as a ‘Not Met’ (i.e. fail), due to the risks it introduces around not understanding user needs and designing inappropriate solutions.\n\n\n\n\nWhile we want to encourage and enable all teams to adopt UCD approaches and bring in UCD specialists, we have to be aware of team contexts and constraints.\nTo put forward a balanced view, not every team will need every specialist role and there are some trade-offs to decide around acceptable risks. I’ve tried to summarise these insights below:\n\n\n\nTypical roles: UX Consultants, UX/UI’rs, UX Designers, Business Analysts, Product Managers\n\nTeams without budget for all the roles\nIf you only have enough specialist work for a part-time role\nWhere the team are not sure what they need - flexible\nIf the project is simple and does not need specialist skills or knowledge\nWhere you can safely outsource the specialist parts of the work\nWhere you have training/resources/tools and can upskill staff on missing skills\nWhen quality is less of a concern (e.g. feels it may be quicker to “ship it” due to less handovers)\nCulture: “It is a team sport, everyone does everything”\n\nRisks:\n\nConformation bias when combining UR+design roles (marking your own homework)\nGeneralists may not have up to date industry knowledge for all the specialisms\nUnclear roles and responsibilities - everyone needs to know about everything\nThe team maybe overconfident in their abilities\nThese teams might need more external perspectives / reflection and assurance of the work\nHigher risk of delivering the wrong thing. Getting it all wrong, lowering quality, or doing something dangerous\nAdditional clinical risk and reputational damage\nTakes longer. Productivity stops when things need to be rebuilt again\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical roles: User research, Content design, Interaction Design, Service Design, Accessibility and Inclusion, Performance Analysts, Research Operations\n\nWhen you need clear separation of roles (e.g. UR / design) to avoid conflict/bias in decision making\nWhere you need subject matter expertise / technical knowledge / years of experience\nWhere the work involved is complex, controversial or a top priority (e.g. new national service)\nCulture: “It is a team sport. Everyone involved as needed, but specialists lead/oversee the work”\nWhen it is good to have diverse views within a team - encourage debate around issues and priorities\nWhen the team are being assured to industry standards (CDDO/DHSC/etc)\nWhere you know the work will be subject to external scrutiny (e.g. get a reputable researcher to lead it)\nWhere you need peer/industry support/engagement or ethical approval to proceed (e.g. within the Community of Practice / Profession Head)\nWhere budget allows - it will lead to better quality and outcomes\nSome roles may be safer to join in a single role if the skills complement each other (e.g. SD+IXD, Content+IXD, Quant UR+Performance Analytics, Inclusion+Accessibility, BA+PM),\n\nRisks:\n\nCosts more\nBigger team to manage - more interdependencies and moving parts\nCan take longer to reach higher quality standard. It may delay delivery (initially until the team is established), though in the long run better service design means less rework\nWhat to do if one area of the specialist work dries up - do you have flexible skills\nIf combining two roles, need to be realistic about how much time spend on each part of role\n\n\n\n\n\nA few recommendations:\n\nAsk about joining the NHSE or X-Gov UCD Maturity Community of Practice\nArrange a chat with NHSE UCD Team about the UCD Maturity Framework\nCreate a roles and responsibilities matrix for your team.\n\nConsider who is covering different areas such as user research, accessibility, inclusion, content design, etc. How much of the teams time is dedicated to each of these specialist activities?\n\nJoin the professional Community of Practices for the specialist areas you need more expertise on\nPresent your research/designs to the professional Community of Practices - seek internal feedback\nGeneralists can learn more about UCD.\n\nThere are loads of introductory courses which may be suitable\ne.g. on Pluralsight, Futurelearn, Civil Service Learning, YouTube\nIt won’t make a generalist a specialist over-night, but helps with collaboration and understanding how roles complement each other\n\nRead the DDAT UCD Job Family\n\nIncludes overview of specialist roles and the work required at each seniority level. (\nReview JDs - often there are several pages of technical skills/requirements for each UCD specialist role!\n\nAsking how do we hire more specialist staff for our team? Speak to your Profession Heads!\n\nAs always, any thoughts are massively appreciated! :)\nTom"

Everyone involved as needed, but specialists lead/oversee the work”\nWhen it is good to have diverse views within a team - encourage debate around issues and priorities\nWhen the team are being assured to industry standards (CDDO/DHSC/etc)\nWhere you know the work will be subject to external scrutiny (e.g. get a reputable researcher to lead it)\nWhere you need peer/industry support/engagement or ethical approval to proceed (e.g. within the Community of Practice / Profession Head)\nWhere budget allows - it will lead to better quality and outcomes\nSome roles may be safer to join in a single role if the skills complement each other (e.g. SD+IXD, Content+IXD, Quant UR+Performance Analytics, Inclusion+Accessibility, BA+PM),\n\nRisks:\n\nCosts more\nBigger team to manage - more interdependencies and moving parts\nCan take longer to reach higher quality standard. It may delay delivery (initially until the team is established), though in the long run better service design means less rework\nWhat to do if one area of the specialist work dries up - do you have flexible skills\nIf combining two roles, need to be realistic about how much time spend on each part of role\n\n\n\n\n\nA few recommendations:\n\nAsk about joining the NHSE or X-Gov UCD Maturity Community of Practice\nArrange a chat with NHSE UCD Team about the UCD Maturity Framework\nCreate a roles and responsibilities matrix for your team.\n\nConsider who is covering different areas such as user research, accessibility, inclusion, content design, etc. How much of the teams time is dedicated to each of these specialist activities?\n\nJoin the professional Community of Practices for the specialist areas you need more expertise on\nPresent your research/designs to the professional Community of Practices - seek internal feedback\nGeneralists can learn more about UCD.\n\nThere are loads of introductory courses which may be suitable\ne.g. on Pluralsight, Futurelearn, Civil Service Learning, YouTube\nIt won’t make a generalist a specialist over-night, but helps with collaboration and understanding how roles complement each other\n\nRead the DDAT UCD Job Family\n\nIncludes overview of specialist roles and the work required at each seniority level. (\nReview JDs - often there are several pages of technical skills/requirements for each UCD specialist role!\n\nAsking how do we hire more specialist staff for our team? Speak to your Profession Heads!\n\nAs always, any thoughts are massively appreciated! :)\nTom"

    "text": "People are what make healthcare work. There is a human role in every good bit of the experience\nContinues from part 1\nAlong my journey, from what I noticed, the most (useful) digital processes included:\nThat was it. None of the hospital staff-facing information was visible to me as a citizen.\nAs I sat in the hospital waiting area with an head injury (for over 5 hours), I had no clue what was happening with my care. Was there a plan?\nAt times high and specific expectations were set by staff: “you need a CT and to see a doctor”.\nAt other times updates were pretty vague “You are near the top of the pile”.\nThe pain was held back by Codeine, paracetemol, and the fact I didn’t need a stretcher. Several patients either arrived on a trolley or collapsed and had to be rushed through on one.\nThe waiting room is full (as expected). Diverse attendence, all ethnicities. Families, crying kids, drug users, drunk and disorderly, the homeless, foreign speakers, couples, individuals, sad people, happy people, vomitting people, screaming people.\nSome other patients clearly had less patience, e.g. asking what was going on every 30 minutes. Bothering staff more seemed to help people to get seen sooner.\nI didn’t want to do this, but after 5 hours of watching who went in next you start to question the British Queuing etiquette.\nLots of people got up and left despite having waited many hours and were not being seen or treated.\nIn the end, I had to request more pain killers as the first batch wore off. After that request, I was seen within 1 hour.\nAfter my named was called things were pretty fast: seen by a doctor, checked over, x-rayed, checked again, sent home.\nA few days later, I feel pretty ok now apart from the significant bruising and swelling.\nA lucky escape!"

    "text": "National digital healthcare - why so many missed opportunities\nThese are some challenges that I came up against. Friday night may have been a better with a bit more digital?\nBut then again, maybe none of this is even necessary? Maybe just ideas from LaLaLand.\nI got treated and got safely home and I am really very grateful for that.\nObviously, these ideas for improving urgent healthcare wouldn’t have replaced the essential human interactions described above.\n\n999\n\nI work in the NHS and know they are always super busy! there was no way I was ringing 999 or an ambulance for myself after this accident!\nAs a typical parent, I pretend to be fine in for the kids and other parents (despite a huge golf ball bump and blood streaming everywhere)\nI was in denial and had concussion. I didn’t perceive that I was injured badly\nAfter 5 or 6 adults told me I needed to go to hospital (including 3 first aiders), I agreed it was the best option and so we set off\n\nAccurate closing times for the Urgent Treatment Walk-in Centres (UTC)\n\nadvertised on Google as 11pm, but doors closed to patients at 9pm\n\nCorrect available facilities at UTC\n\nTheir website says they deal with severe head injuries, but the reality is they didn’t have staff, X-ray or CT scan available\n\nHospital-hospital transfers - UTC staff say they do not refer to hospital A&E.\n\nI was unsure if any notes were made or if a referral was created after I left. I assume local NHS providers use the same system, but I maybe wrong.\n\nCheck A&E waiting times before you arrive\n\nis it worth driving extra 20 minutes to another A&E\ne.g. York/Harrogate might be quiet - can you beat a 6 hour wait in Leeds?\n\nLive wait times for treatments and severity\n\ne.g. x-ray, CT or electronic display\nmake it clear how many are waiting in each category: critical, servere, routine\nshows how many cases they have by severity\ntell you which category you are in\nunclear if it is 2 hours or 10 hours\nat 1am some patients said they have been waiting since 5pm (8 hours?!)\n\nBooking appointments/Scans\n\nIt appears no appointments can be booked between A&E and UTC?\nWhen they knew I was travelling over to LGI/A&E. They could have booked the x-ray and sent me to that waiting area on arrival. Rather than the long wait and being triaged three times\n\nCheck-in on app when in arrivals/waiting area\n\nEasy as Toolstation and Screwfix\nUnclear what the added value of the frontline desk (unless you are lost, or don’t have a phone)\n\n111/NHS App\n\nI had completely forgot about this service. I tried the 111 triage 2 hours after being sat in A&E.\nIt says to call 999 for ambulance (ironically).\nI’m not sure how this channel would have much helped here, we had already decided to go to the hospital.\nperhaps guidance for what to bring on a 6/7 hour A&E hospital trip (e.g phone charger, water bottle, warm coat, food, money)\n\nTracking patients around the hospital waiting areas:\n\nreduces time wasted for staff walking around asking other staff and patients where people are\nreduce shouting out names and mispronouncing foreign names\nidentify who the sleeping people are without waking them up\nreduce the fear around going to the toilet and missing your name call!\nTry allocating seat numbers? or using NFC seat tags?\nor Using GPS tracking of your phone / NHS App?\nor track patient location on CCTV with machine learning?\n\nFood and drinks to your seat\n\nInjured people leaving because they are hungry\nAll coffee shops were shut, food/drinks trolley arrived once during 6 hours\nCan you order Uber Eats or Deliveroo to the waiting room? LOL now you are just being lazy Tom, but I guess many people try this.\n\nFree USB charging within the hospital\n\nsituation is you need to know to bring your own plug socket and cable, or bring a charging pack, or pay to borrow a USB charger\n\nBetter information about medicines.\n\nAfter receiving some medicine, no info was provided about dosage or side effects to look out for.\nHow long do they last before I need more?\nThere is no record of receiving acute meds on my patient record\n\nMeds check up\n\na way to request more medicines, as I had to disrupt the nurse who was checking another patient\n\nPain tracking\n\nis it getting better/worse? has the bleeding stopped?\nperhaps use 8k cameras and machine learning to observe and monitor patient situation directly\n\nTriage outcome summary\n\ninitially told I need a CT scan, by time I see nurse and then doctor downgraded to x-ray check\nif I had a memory loss problem after severe head injury this could have been quite difficult to recall\n\nDealing with overcrowding / flow issues\n\ne.g. someone needs a quick tetanus jab after a dog bite, why waited nearly 6 hours?\nbooking them into priority UTC/GP appointment in the morning could free up 2 seats in the busy waiting area\n\nA&E visit in your patient record\n\nNothing appears on the NHS App medical record; apparently I didn’t visit?\n\nWaiting on your own could be quite lonely\n\nI’m sure something here about how could a chat system, or patient profile matching, or patient-generated entertainment highlights channel would be much better than the single small TV hidden in the corner playing a raunchy romcom.\n\nLanguage translation\n\nA parent speaking an international language collapsed, their kids didn’t speak much English\nIt was unclear if a translator was available. Could digital translation help more?\n\nFree Wi-Fi\n\nI’m pretty sure it was available.\nThough I’m a sceptic and didn’t connect because you can’t tell know which one is real and secure\nNo signage saying which hospital network to use\nDo cyber security teams identify and remove the rogue networks?\n\nTest results\n\nscans images are saved in the patient record\nstaff can see them, why not citizens?\n\nDischarge notes\n\nwith a head injury I was required to take my own notes\ninformation about medications / recovery / aftercare should be send to your phone\nunclear whether it gets sent to the GP as well?\n\nFollow-up Referrals\n\ncould an automated follow-up with GP / physio be created. Really useful if your condition gets worse.\ne.g. after I got woke eye socket feels disjointed. I noticed my shoulder was really badly bumped to and it is unclear that was x-rayd?\nobviously most of the attention was on my face/head injury. have they already checked for a dislocated shoulder or fractured ribs? who knows. Again seeing what had been x-rayd might answer that."

Despite my advancing expectations set by sci-fi visions of health in movies and the media each year.\n\n“How do we keep our teams motivated to focussing on moving things forward when there are many blockers, legacy constraints, and a lot of uncertainty across the system?”\n\n\nhow can we align our teams around highest-priority areas of clinical risk?\nhow do we create bigger impact from our research projects?\nhow do we better represent the communities we serve?\nhow can we connect with colleagues from across the whole healthcare system?\nhow can we find nad share evidence of unmet user needs, aligning this with policy?\nhow can we better track our progress and the impact of decision making?\n\nIn summary, who the heck knows what the future holds for the NHS!\nOur user researchers are immersed in the frontline system and policy problems evey day. It is difficult work. It can be quite intense, traumatising and frustrating.

    "text": "Things I’ve achieved during 12 months in UCD Team in the Lead User Researcher / UCD Lead role\nThe last year has been very challenging both at work and outside of work. I started my current role in June 2022 and this post wraps up some of the things over the last year.\nIt has been an honour to be able take on such a key role during a time of significant change for our organisations. I feel I have continued to grow and thrive in the role as Lead User Researcher. I particuarly enjoyed the variety of projects that I’ve been involved with (thrown into) in so far, as well meeting and working closely with many amazing teams and colleagues across the wider business.\nThe Central UCD Team are all especially brilliant and helpful colleagues. Excellent onboarding, always open to hear each others perspectives, and help each other to succeed. It has been a real shame also to lose some colleagues during the ongoing merger, however I’m still optimistic about the organisation future generally - maybe things will be more stable in 6-12 months. Things are starting to settle out and we are seeing real positive impact from some of the longer-term projects we have delivered.\nUCD Maturity\nI hosted our monthly community of practice during the last year. This has been the most intriguing and one of the most challenging workstreams. Taking on the multiple-hats of coaching, supporting and enabling teams to review their UCD practices. I worked across the business to gather feedback, review and refine the UCD Maturity Framework, simplifying the workshop process and increased the focus around inclusion and equity. I arranged and facilitated four workshops, including a face-to-face workshop for 30 staff in London, as well as introducing 25 colleagues to the role of UCD Facilitator.\nUCD Operations in Health community\nI chaired monthly meetings for the UCD Operations in Health Community. These sessions were pivotal in bringing together Re-Ops and design colleagues during a period of uncertainty leading up to organisational merger. Through our shared interests and goals, we started to align around tooling, guidance. We shared our (NHSD) ways of working, encouraged adoption of our guidanced. We championed our expertise across the ‘merged’ business, ensuring the Central UCD Team continued to lead UCD operations into the new organisation.\nUser Research Lab\nWorking closely with colleagues, I helped finalise the research lab designs, ensured suppliers delivered to the high quality spec, launched the lab, tested all equipment, iterated documentation, demoed the lab experience to over 100+ colleagues, resolved technical issues, trained multiple teams on using the lab. We also improved the accessible of the UR lab by having hearing loops integrated within the research and observation rooms. I supported several lab days with NHS Login and NHS.uk, briefed our CEO (Simon Bolton for NHSD) and the NHSE Directors (Amanda Pritchard and team) on the benefits of User Research and the research lab.\nSoftware governance\nI worked closely with Tech Services to transition ownership of tools such as Qualtrics, provide operating procedures and guidance to allow self-service, helping to increase the uptake of the tool from 100-&gt;300 staff across the business, while also reducing the burden of requests on the Central UCD Team. As Information Asset Owner I conducted a review of data governance and put plans in place to improve our approach to data management across the business.\nKnowledge management\nI reviewed the information architecture of our internal Sharepoint, Teams and Confluence spaces. I documented the needs of UR professional colleagues, worked collaboratively to iterate current content and co-created new content to better meet the needs of ucd-colleagues. I created policy guidance, reguarly communicated changes to colleagues at profession meet-ups, collected new requirements from colleagues and ran sessions to prioritise issues.\nParticipant Recruitment and Panels\nI hosted a fortnightly community of practice during the year. I completed a brief internal discovery, analysed demographic content patterns, launched the NHS Staff panel (an integrated participant database using the Qualtrics survey CRM tools). This enabled teams to improve the timeliness of their staff recruitment activity, as well as broaden the diversity of participants they recruit fo research.\nWays of working\nI always championed working in the open. One change I made included migrating part of our backlog onto the Jira platform. This made the requests visible to colleagues across the UR profession and wider audience, it increased the awareness of the number of requirement, and encouraged collaboration and shared ownership. I continued to blog regularly throughout the year about my work and some challenges outside of work.\nBudget and spending\nI supported writing business cases with evidence of usage/value, seeking funding for expanding the toolset available to colleagues. I also helped raise a case to reduce risks such as data breaches. I conducted cost-benefit analysis for various tools/services, as well as staff costs for the UR profession, UCD-operations team and whether internal/external participant recruitment is more cost effective.\nClient management\nI managed supplier engagement: with Userzoom, Qualtrics, Optimal Workshop, etc, to ensure we are getting the best support possible and that our profession are making good use of tools. I was involved in negotiations over account access, features, usage limits, as well as setting up various workshops with our suppliers to understand the changing needs of internal teams.\nResearch library\nI helped put the case to Head of Research that more needed to be done to enable insight sharing across the business, to reduce duplication of work across departments, and to ensure data is not lost as we move into the new organisation. This has lead to budget being approved for a supplier to run an Alpha/Beta workstream in the near future.\n100-day NHS discharge challenge\nI was dropped into at short notice. This was the one of the most stressful but interesting projects of the year. To enable the implementation team to survey ALL hospital trusts on their plans for discharge over the winter period. Gathering quant data and bringing in their baseline data to compare from a previous iteration. It involved working to (a lapsed) ministerial deadline, designing a database system, creating a very complex survey, and data analysis. Within 2 weeks of understanding the requirements and delivering the survey, the data-gathering project was miraculosuly back on track, albeit after a huge effort by colleagues in the implementation team - nearly all the trusts returned data.\nUser Research SME\nI provided ongoing operational subject-matter expertise for the user research profession (120 staff). What the heck is that? It means helping teams to resolve thousands of small, medium and large / complex queries in a timely manner. This goes across all UR topics, from the research lab, guidance, policy, training, tools, surveys, staffing, assurance, IG, recruitment etc, etc. Being visible is important, I am always approachable via many channels (Slack, Teams, email, phone, in the office) as well as via the shared UCD mailbox.\nOne major takeaway about the role of an UCD operations manager, you need to work really closely with teams, undertand their priorities and be responsive to their needs. Colleagues are less interested in grand visions and multi-year plans, especially when basic needs are not me and it feels like everyone is fire-fighting. Ask yourself, what can support can you do to help resolve their problems today? It is also why non-ucd practictioning staff might struggle in UCD-ops roles, you need to have good experience of subject matter to provide good quality solutions.\nProfessional development\nI completed the Anti-Racism Allies training for senior managers across the NHSE/HEE/NHSD organisations. This really helped me broaden my appreciation of the problem of institutional racism that colleagues from different backgrounds face, as well as appreciate the unconscious bias white people benefit from every day. On a practical level, this helped me with understanding how to structure workshops to enable everyone to have a voice, as well as find ways to provide opportunities to those who might previously have felt excluded.\nPersonal development\nI continued to my learning journey around improving my skills for data analysis and coding outside of work. I have found this an enjoyable hobby that has been something I can also do with my kids current interests in Minecraft, it helps with their school homework activities too. I also continued my various diy home-improvement projects, working with difficult suppliers and agreeing the scope of work, negotiate skills have never been more valuable.\nOutside of work: I continue to manage own health and wellbeing… often in less than ideal circumstances. Single parenting two kids alone, having had Covid multiple times, and suffering a recent head injury and hospitalisation. I try to manage my mental health with keeping activate with regular swimming and membership of our local running club. Alongside regularly volunteering activities where possible!\nTom\n\n\n\n\nLet me know what you thought below"

    "text": "Things I did this week\n\nResearch lab - 3 days onsite support. I ran a training session for colleagues as well as being available for technical and practical support. I’ve noticed teams who have used our lab facilities before are getting much more organised and are (nearly) mostly self-sufficient.\nKnowledge management - with the NHS.net Sharepoint migration completed we’re cracking on with updating documentation for UCD colleagues. Ensuring colleagues get a seamless onboarding, can easily access tools, guidance and protocals is helping us to scale good practice more quickly. We’re always looking to share more templates across teams. Every two weeks our team host a workshop to share and review new guidance.\nConnecting the dots. Colleagues often reach out with random adhoc queries. Inevitably there is someone somewhere in the business who we can point colleagues towards. This week there were teams who are following similar journeys (albeit a few years out of sync), as well connecting teams whose immediate goals are interdependent.\nI generally spent a lot of time shielding other teams from complexity - enabling them to do their jobs without having to navigate internal minefields. Challenging stakeholders, complex approval processes, technically challenging issues, that is what ops are here for: to enable teams across the business to work seamlessly and improve quality where we can!"

We’ve been trying to resolve this problem for over a year, with multiple teams and stakeholders involved. It seems still were unclear who can help, what approval processes we need to follow. The technical teams we have reached don’t have time to explore the complex issue (or even reply).\nMore technology problems. Things at the research lab might be a little more complex than needed, but as the system was installed by a third-party, we had little choice over the equipment that was ultimately selected. The tool does meet all our needs in that it has a lot features, flexibility, security - however usability is also an important factor. Media streaming companies and hardware suppliers could take notice here. Many hardware user interfaces are stuck in the 90s."

    "text": "What challenged me to think differently this week?\nI visited two new pubs, one was ‘a bit off the grid’ you might say. Socialising with people, wherever they are from, and hearing their stories can really broaden your perspectives.\nI had an interesting discussion about impact. While colleagues and stakeholders in the wider business might be interested research and design processes, they rightly question why some research projects take so long, or have no specific end-user value.\nIt is easy to forget, but the NHS has decades of performance improvement teams trying things out and local services are often finely-tuned in many cases.\nMany teams I see are usability testing content, styling and micro-interactions. Yes ‘design systems’ are important, but for stakeholders it doesn’t really grab their attention.\nSome of the questions we might consider ourselves:\n\nhow might we zoom out and see the bigger picture?\nhow can we align ourselves to NHS priorities? or KPIs?\nhow might we be more impactful in our research outcomes?\nhow can we pilot/experiment more quickly?\nhow might we work more closely with local/regional organisations?\nhow might we drive changes forward?\n\nHave a great week!\nTom\n\n\n\nLet me know what you thought below"

Also interestingly, and ironically as I had 6 calls with 111, a colleague mentioned that 111 recently removed ear ache infection from their service (that week!) as part of the ‘Pharmacy First’ initiative.\nI was in a lot of pain and almost willing to pay Livi for an urgent appointment if things fell through. Luckily I did get through at 8.01am, attended GP at 9.15 and picked up eardrops by 9.30am - Great!\nHaving a temporary disability (hearing loss and dizziness) reminded me how disruptive and difficult it can be just to do the basics, and also how difficult it must be for people with permanent hearing loss.\nEar drops kicked in two days later, dizziness went away, and I was able to recover quickly.\nOn Sunday I ran in a 12-mile cross-country relay race, “The Leeds Country Way”. Our pair ran the batten round in 1 hour 38 minutes, 22 minutes under the cut-off time! We were well chuffed with this considered we both had recent ankle injuries. Don’t mention what happened to our relay team after that!"

Always relevant to ask the question ‘what problem/risks are we trying to solve for?’ and ‘how can we make it more relatable to the work our NHS colleagues are doing?’\nUCD Maturity Model - kick off calls and resource sharing with four teams. Some interest from the x-gov community. My takeout here is that awareness of the UCD Maturity resources is low, but interest in the benefits the framework can drive is fairly high.\nNew starters – several contractors arrived this week, which is great after many months of staff hiring freeze / battling through approvals.\nOnboarding - we had the usual fun with onboarding staff, digging out historical policies , sorting access to technology, initial kickoff chats\nSupplier onboarding:\n\ngreat to meet Dan from NexerDigital who is working with Ellen and Leigh to rollout the Accessibility Lab, a quick tour around the UR Lab\n\ngreat to chat with Raoul from NetCompany – always interesting to hear about how suppliers previous work with different departments and their areas of expertise.\n\n\nThe opportunity here is around how can contractors/suppliers play a role in capacity building / training our permanent members of staff?"

The Central UCD Ops team are very sceptical this will work out, knowing the needs of participants and how UR teams operate. Not only is this an administrative nightmare but there is also a big risk of reducing inclusivity. We’ve put our evidence forward and escalated to management the risks to research, service design, the business and the wider public.\nTech suppliers – fixing outages and issues in a timely manner, coordinating fixes across multiple suppliers has been problematic. But we need to complete this work to enable our colleagues to do work effectively and safely.\n\nI found time to reflect on some of these challenges, they seem to be linked to how our professions communicate insights or problems with our leadership team and directors. What could we do to close this insight gap and ensure senior backing for our ways of working?\nThere was a great podcast on ‘Awkward Silences’ this week about how we can better meet our Stakeholder needs.
