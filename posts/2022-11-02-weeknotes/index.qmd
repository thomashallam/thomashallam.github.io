<h3>What's going on Tom</h3>

* <b>The Leeds UX Lab.</b> Everything is in place to launch this venue for our colleagues to use very soon. 
It has been a real long road, with so many hurdles to overcome; it was quite an emotional time when we received our training and supplier handover last week. This week I visited again to test out everything we learnt, I plugged in all the equipment and clicked the 'Start', 'Record' and 'Go Live' buttons on the controls. Everything worked as anticipated such a relief!

* Behind the scenes we've been 'doing the hard work' on our <b>Knowledge Management/Documentation/Policies</b> to support our teams and colleagues during the merger. These resources will help ensure things aren't lost in transmission but also supports scalability as the organisations align. We're always looking to collaborate and if teams have resources they can happily feed them into our documentation process.

* Meeting a key supplier. We've been working together remotely for many years, so it was great to finally meet the supplier for a brief chat in Leeds and share more about the context in which we work and opportunities to improve the relationship between our researchers and support teams.

<h3>Challenges and puzzles this week</h3>

* I was super busy over half-term with family and work. I've booked 3 days off to repair my mental health and tidy up some things. I've personally been through some difficult times during the past few years; I'm not sure I have the mental capacity to go deep thinking at this time. It is so much pressure just to be a good adult role model for 2 kids every day, and run a tight ship; my own needs are to relax, enjoy life and learn how to build trust in people again.

* Coping with a recent loss in the family.
