Research in healthcare or govevernment can be quite dangerous if not done properly:

* findings that are harmful to users/citizens, 
* traumatic experiences for researchers and their colleagues, 
* products and services designed inappropriately/not tested properly... 

If you are doing User Research in a healthcare context, you really need to get it right.

As a hiring manager, we need to help the business understand the difference in UR skillsets, what is value of a good or great researcher?

Their is huge demand for UX talent right now.

It is so bad that some teams are willing to hire anyone! The risk of not hiring could mean their programme fails it's Service Assessments and lose funding/be cancelled. 

However, hiring people with an inadequate skill set can make delivery dangerous for users! 

If you are hiring it is important to assess the market before you post adverts. If your team can secure additional an £50-£100 a day for hiring, you might get some great UR staff applying.

For me it's a simple question:

* do you want to hire staff staff who have limited experience, or some skills for the job? taking a risk they have no skills?
* or do do you want to hire staff with significant experience, all the skills needed (and often more), for a small % more?

It is a simple choice
