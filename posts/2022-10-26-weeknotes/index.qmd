<h3>Some positive news</h3>
* We've been working hard to increase awareness of the <b>User Centre-Desing Maturity Model</b>, Self-Review Workshops, and Community of Practice. Things were abit slow over the summer months, but gradually things really started to take off. 
A few larger teams are super keen and booked in lots of workshops, and rightly so some of our teams are skeptical "what another 3 hour workshop?"
It does take a while to build up trust and explain the benefits. It is not for our UCD leaders and workshop faciliators to push for workshops too hard, we take a coaching approach and the tool is a self-review process... the evidence of impact can be heard loudly from the great feedback from teams have taken part about the positive changes it has supported them to make.

* The <b>'Reseaarch Panels Best Practice'</b> workstream is starting to deliver positive outcomes. We've designed new way of communicating and recruiting healthcare staff and "professional users". A pilot has been completed with over 50 staff signing up for the new panel. We're next working on a comms plan to roll out the service for all our researchers shortly! 

* <b>Anti-Racism Allies training</b> - this training (run by HEE) got me reflecting quite deeply on my own personal history and where I grew up. There were some really nice people on the course. Note all the course attendees were white managers from the NHS and our cohort will meet up during 6-month programme. I'm hopeful that I can learn more about myself, gain some wider perspectives, and understand how I can be a better ally in the future. 


<h3>Challenges and puzzles this week</h3>

* Taking on way too much. Our UCD-Ops team is really small,  there are so many teams that need help and the problems are often very complex. I really really (really really) enjoy helping people and it gives a great boost when we hear positive feedback from colleagues after helping them, we just want to help more. However, I realise that by helping people all the time it can be a burden on myself, and the team. We've talked about pushing back more and what can we do to ensure everyone gets a fair amount of help and they become self-sufficient. We're looking at ways our team can better signpost help to reduce the number of repeated request.
